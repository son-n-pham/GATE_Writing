The wind howled like a hungry wolf, and the ground trembled beneath our feet. Outside the dome, the world was a chaotic mess of swirling tornadoes, crashing waves, and erupting volcanoes. But inside, our little house was a haven of warmth and safety.

My family huddled around the fireplace, the flickering flames casting dancing shadows on the walls. My little sister, Lily, clutched her teddy bear, her eyes wide with a mixture of fear and fascination. My older brother, Tom, was glued to the window, watching the storm rage outside. My parents tried to keep us calm, but I could see the worry etched on their faces.

"Will the dome hold?" Lily whispered, her voice trembling.

"Of course, it will," my father said, his voice firm but gentle. "It's the strongest dome ever built."

But I knew that even the strongest things could break. I had heard stories of the old days, before the dome, when the storms had ravaged the coast. I had seen the pictures in the history books, the images of destruction and despair.

Suddenly, a loud crack echoed through the house. We all jumped, our hearts pounding in our chests. Tom pointed to the ceiling, where a thin line had appeared, snaking its way across the dome.

"It's cracking!" he shouted, his voice filled with panic.

The line grew wider, and a small piece of the dome fell to the floor with a loud thud. We all stared at the hole, our faces pale with fear. The wind howled louder, and the rain began to pour in.

We knew that our safe haven was no longer safe. We had to find a way to survive.
