After reviewing the three writings, I have ranked them based on engagement as follows:

1. student_sue.md: This piece is the most engaging due to its surreal tone, vivid descriptions, and focus on the character's internal experience. The writing style is sophisticated, creating a sense of mystery and unease.

2. student_skylar.md: This piece is the second most engaging due to its direct, informal style, relatable frustration, and humor. The character's personality is clear, and the narrative is grounded in the immediate situation.

3. example_essay_from_AI.md: While well-written and descriptive, this piece lacks the unique voice and emotional depth of the other two, making it the least engaging. It is more of a general observation without the personal touch that makes the other two stand out.
