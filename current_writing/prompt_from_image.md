# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "I see a group of young people, presumably students, engaged in what appears to be an esports gaming session. They are seated at individual workstations set up in a large room with light-colored walls. Each station has a laptop, a mouse, and a headset. Some of the individuals are actively playing the game shown on their screens, while others are looking at their laptops or at other people. There is a person standing behind one of the tables, and also another person standing in the back of the image. The dominant colors are warm browns from the wooden desk structures, and blacks from the accessories and clothing. The computer screens glow with the light from game. Some people wear red or maroon clothing. One individual's t-shirt has text that says 'RSHS eSports'.",
