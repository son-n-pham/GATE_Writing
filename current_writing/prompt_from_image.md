# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "The image shows a cartoon scene inside a kitchen. The two characters appear to be from the animated TV show 'BoJack Horseman'. On the left side, a brown horse-headed anthropomorphic character with a dark mane is seated at a table. He's wearing a light orange sweater with pink apples and crosses and blue jeans. He's pointing his right index finger towards a large, round, light-yellow item on a plate at the center of the table. In front of the horse, we can see a silver fork. On the right side, there's a blonde-haired woman standing holding a silver pitchfork. She is wearing a long-sleeved shirt with red, blue, green and yellow squares and a purple skirt with white lines. The background consists of a kitchen with light orange cabinets and white walls. There is a tan microwave, a white jar with a lid on the counter, a white phone on the wall and a white dish drying rack on the right side of the image. The table is white and is in the middle of the scene.",
