# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "I see an illustration of two mice in a bedroom. The larger mouse sits up in bed, wearing a shirt and pants, and reading a book titled \"Classic Fairy Tales\" to a smaller mouse beside them. The bed has a quilt with colorful square patches. The bedroom is cozy and rustic, with a wooden headboard, and the walls appear to be made of tree branches. A framed picture hangs on the wall above the headboard, and there is a shelf with books on the right side of the image. A bedside table holds a lit oil lamp, an apple, and what appears to be a key. At the foot of the bed, toy blocks and a train set are visible. The title \"BEDTIME STORY\" is above the illustration in bold text. The color palette consists of warm earth tones like browns, greens, and reds, creating a comforting atmosphere.\n\nThe writing task requires students to write a short story or narrative based on the image, perhaps about the fairy tales being read, the relationship between the mice, or the setting in the cozy bedroom.\n\nThis image serves as a prompt by providing a visual narrative that can spark imagination and creativity, inviting writers to explore the characters, setting, and possible plot points suggested by the scene."
