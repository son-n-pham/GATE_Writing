  "description": "The image shows a person overwhelmed by a large pile of text message bubbles. The person, drawn in a simple, cartoonish style, is positioned at the bottom of the image, partially buried under the text bubbles. Their head and shoulders are visible, and they are holding a cell phone in their hands, suggesting they are still engaged with the device despite being engulfed by texts. The text bubbles are a mix of light blue and light gray, and they are stacked and overlapping, forming a sort of hill or mound. The background is a plain, off-white or light gray. The overall feel of the image is one of being overwhelmed or burdened by communication.",
