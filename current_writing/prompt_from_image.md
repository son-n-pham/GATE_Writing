# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "The image shows a domestic interior with a cat as the central subject. The cat is sitting in a blue armchair and using a silver Samsung laptop. It is wearing glasses, which gives it an intellectual appearance. The room has yellow floral wallpaper, a small wooden side table with a lamp and a mug on top of it, and a folded newspaper beneath it, and several framed photos of cats hanging on the wall. On the floor there is a pair of green slippers. The cat is a tabby cat with brown and black markings, and the room is lit with a warm light, likely from the lamp on the side table. The wall hanging includes four pictures in brown frames. One picture is of a gray kitten, one is of two cats snuggling, one is of the main cat wearing a captain's hat, and the fourth one is of the main cat wearing a blond wig.",

  "writing_task_requirements": "The writing task requires students to imagine a narrative based on the image. They might need to create a story about the cat, what it's doing on the laptop, its role in the house, or the kind of personality it has. The image could also be used to write a creative piece about the domestic life of cats, or a fictional story about the catâ€™s background story as hinted by the framed pictures on the wall.",
  "prompt_summary": "This image serves as a prompt by offering a whimsical and unusual scene that blends the mundane (a cat using a laptop) with the quirky (framed pictures of the cat in costumes and accessories). It encourages writers to think creatively, develop characters, and create narratives that play with the unusual elements presented in the scene. The setup of the room implies a normal life setting, but the cat being the active protagonist makes it funny."
