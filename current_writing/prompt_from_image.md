# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "The image is a drawing depicting three people sitting in what appears to be a train or bus. The drawing uses simple lines and a limited color palette, primarily consisting of shades of blue, grey, and black. The background shows a series of light grey rectangles and horizontal blue lines representing the train's windows and interior paneling. The three characters are stylized and not drawn with realistic proportions. On the left, a man with short black hair and a checkered blue and white shirt looks downward. He is holding something in his hands, possibly a phone. Next to him is a woman with shoulder length dark hair wearing a gray dress who appears to be looking down as well. On the right, another woman with dark hair tied up in two buns is looking towards the right, wearing a white dress with blue polka dots. The seats they are sitting in are also stylized, with blue dotted pattern for the seat and a black linear structure. The drawing style is child-like and naive.",
