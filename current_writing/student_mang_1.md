As the towering door quickly slammed, a tall figure entered the pristine and vacated house. As if on a cue, Maximillious swiftly pounced onto the small wooden desk. He paused before diving to the bowl housing his food, like a flow of water gushing down a cliff. Maximillious, hesitant on devouring his superb and succulent meal of cat food peered at his owner. He seemed dormant, glaring at a neon white screen, his glasses appearing to fall off. His fingers moved like a typewriter, blitzing to each minute key.

Intrigued by the sight before him, Max tried to leap up on the smooth fabric chair. He glanced at multiple photos resembling his disapproving stare, before being toppled by the geriatric cat statue that beheld buckets of dust. It seemed to stare at Max, slowly inching its way closer, before suddenly, Max's owner stood up and swiped the statue from the couch it rested on. Seeing the opportunity, Maximillious attempted wielding the glasses, before slowly clicking each individual key.

Shocked, the tall figure stood up! He appeared mad, until patting max on the head. He grinned and let Max dance on the keyboard. Laughter filled the air, as Max grew ever closer to his owner. Eventually feasting on food, they were both happy, hungry and loving. Max really could find a nice life as a cat.
