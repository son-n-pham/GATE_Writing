Well, AI can be quite helpful..." I trailed off as Grandpa howled with laughter, tea splattering like dark ink over my computer. "Who gives a hoot about AI, or whatever new-fangled technology it's called." Grandpa snorted like a pig and chewed his scones loudly. "It's AI, and it's excellent," I shot back immediately.

Grandpa shrugged, smoothing his straggly white mustache. "Young people and their new-fangled ideas." Grandpa was suddenly yelling. "I'D BET ON GOOD OLD MA'S STINKIN' BUTTER THAT AI IS TRASH!"

I buried my face in my hands and groaned miserably. Grandpa was old and senile as a blind, frenzied pig, and he still refused to go to the care home, which was filled with very sane, nice seniors. Now, Grandpa was off rambling about the pure wickedness of AI.

"Grandpa," I said in a slow and measured voice, like I was talking to a naughty kindergartner. 

"I DON'T GIVE A GRANNY'S FANNY!" he interrupted.

"Grandpa," I continued pleasantly. "You have to understand that AI is extremely important and helpful."

Grandpa spat out his sticky jam-covered scone, but I continued. It was as if I was lecturing a toddler who broke a vase. "Imagine you are climbing a mountain. The rocks are jagged and sharp. The cruel wind is pushing you further down. It dances through your hair mockingly. You are about to give up when someone stands above you, reaching out a hand. AI. You see, if you don't accept the massive hand AI is giving you, you will tumble down the mountain like there's no tomorrow. There won't be. You have to understand, Grandpa."

I stared into Grandpa's eyes, which were a kaleidoscope of sparkling colors. He twitched and scratched the tufts of white hair on his head. "Eh?" he said. 

"You heard me," I replied. 
"Whatever. Maybe AI isn't bad, but I KNOW MY STUFF!" Grandpa yelled.

Then, he danced off, cackling, leaving me behind, smiling.
