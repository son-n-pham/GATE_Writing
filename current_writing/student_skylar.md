People have different passions. People have different roads they plan to take. Many of these rugged roads do not include university. What if your dream is to train at TAFE then open the greatest bakery in Australia? Perhaps you want to be part of a teenager rock band and you don't have time for university.

I wholeheartedly agree that education is an important and vital step to become a well-nourished and tall peach tree, but university might not be for everyone. The education system that is currently in place is excellent and flows like petals down a slow stream. Education is for everyone, not just those who pass the university exam.

If we do not include the entrance exam, heedlessly throw away the signs, we will have to create new classes for those who can't keep up, and why do we have to make more classes when we already have other opportunities like TAFE?

The questions just go around in perpetual motion. We all wonder what will happen, and I am sure nothing needs to happen. The system is not as flawless as a model's teeth but it is as best as it can ever be.

The text effectively argues for recognizing diverse educational paths while acknowledging the importance of maintaining educational standards. It uses beautiful metaphors to convey its message and makes a compelling case for accepting alternative educational routes like TAFE alongside traditional university education.
