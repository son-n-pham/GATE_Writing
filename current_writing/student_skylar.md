Rich paws at the brand new laptop. His claws lash out as a bright picture of a dog pops up on the screen. He hisses as he tosses the object away. Rich trots over to a dead goldfish he dug up in the garden and licks it. Then, he turns around and meows smugly as he admires his collection of stolen objects.

Rich lives in a cupboard, a nice toasty cupboard that had been tossed in to an old attic with a tin roof. Rich creeps out like a ninja cat and stealthily steals thingsâ€”shiny diamond rings, batteries, light bulbs and necklaces. He empties out the pantry with his midnight feasts, leaving the poor owner human of the house scared and confused.

Rich adjusts his expensive diamond encrusted tophat and place balances his glasses on his nose as he leaps off his little couch and slips down the attic stairs. He gracefully leaps like a ballerina from object to object, as he finally landing infront of the pantry. He is ready to gorge himself.

Rich eats until his beautiful grey fur is smeared with grease and his stomach is as round as a basketball. He doesn't notice the sun rise above the horizon and doesn't hear the yawning of an awaking human. The food just slips down his throat.

"Hey!" A tall man in striped pyjamas looms menacingly over Rich.
Rich yelps and his tail freezes its continued swishing. The man reaches out a tentative hand and strokes Rich's dirty fur.
"A cat's been stealing my food!" He cries suddenly. He frowns angrily at Rich. Then he smiles.
"I've caught you red-handed, you greedy cat."
The man lifts Rich up until they're nose to nose.
"Have you been stealing? Don't steal from me," He says. "Now where is my jewellry?"
