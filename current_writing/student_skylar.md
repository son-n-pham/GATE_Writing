Dear Aunt Sylvie,

I hope you're well. I guess I'm fine... but not really. Yesterday, I finished writing my story, it was about dragons and a brave knight called Simon who wields an enchanted mystical sword which is studded with little rubies. I bet you'll love it, but I can't show you because a gang of reckless bullies flushed my note book in the toilet.

Right now I am working on a fabulous narrative about a famous acrobat who got murdered, everybody suspects the whole circus worked together to kill the acrobat but it's not true! I hope you'll like it once I finish because nobody at school ever likes my imagination. Hope I can visit you soon!

XOXO Alexa

Dear Aunt Sylvie,

My dog died. Mum says life is full of rollercoasters. She says I should get over it. My heart hurts. I just finished writing my first sad story. Anyways, I've got to go.

Dear Alexa,

I am so sorry for your loss. I also received your murder mystery yesterday. It is most thrilling! I am so proud of you! You must have such a beautiful imagination to be able to write such a magnificent story. You are truly wonderful and I urge you to push on and write a sequel just for me. Once you become a world-famous best selling author I shall be your faithful business partner. Good luck!

Love,
Aunt Sylvie
