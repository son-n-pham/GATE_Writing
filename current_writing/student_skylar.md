Towering above the horizon, reaching up to touch the sky, sits a beautiful white castle, like a crown atop a head. Hypnosis castle shines like a star. It brims with life, a home for the king. He overlooks the city on his balcony - a sleeping city buried in the thick mountainside forest. His servants attend to his every order, scurrying around frantically for towels and blankets, teacups and slippers.

But that's past.

We aren't showering King Charles in every last penny we have. He isn't ordering us about in his majestic palace. In fact, he has no political right! Pure and snobbish monarchy is something we've left behind a long time ago. It is completely unreasonable to be holding big protests to claim King Charles isn't our king!

It's all just tradition, it's actually quite fun. We are no longer beggars crowding around a luxurious castle, we are Australia. We are already woven into the tapestries, it would be too expensive to create a new Australia - despite the distance, we just connected to England. We learn from their posh British mistakes, not erase them.

Now think of that selfish king and his white castle with all the suffering servants dashing about. It seems downright silly that people are concerned about becoming a republic. I love Australia the way it is. We are so far away from castles, dirty cobbled streets, fat greedy kings and people with silly old fashioned thoughts. It is very clear that becoming a republic and worrying about castles and horrible kings is a bad idea.
