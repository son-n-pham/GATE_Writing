My eyes were glued to the screen. My nose almost touched it. I liked. None. Now that I looked at it, I sort of understood why. I had posted a picture of a sandwich I had made with a mayonnaise face on the front. In the flesh, it was lovely, with a dripping patty and melted cheese, except in the picture, the face looked wobbly and the meat dry.

Ping!

My eyes lit up like a light bulb, but then quickly dimmed again. I disliked. Sue tapped me on my shoulder and tutted like a disappointed mother. She jammed the dislike button so many times I thought her screen would crack.

"Get better," she said and rolled her brown eyes.

It hurt like a bee sting as Sue dashed off, but she was back. Her arms were stuffed with items. She set them up in a flash. Just like lightning, the lights dimmed and Sue whipped out the tablecloth.

Grabbing a ladder, she was taking millions of photos at different angles. It made me dizzy looking at her bounce around like a fly, hanging from the lamp and pressing her nose to the sandwich.

Then she stopped.

She typed so fast I thought her fingers would fall off and handed me back my phone. My eyes bulged. She had taken artistic photos, so perfect I could almost taste the tomatoes.

Ping!

My first like. Sue flashed me a toothy grin and sauntered off while singing, "Good luck!" And then I received my first comment. "So pretty!"

My happiness was almost tangible as I grinned widely.

The next week was a blur of photo after photo. The kitchen lights were permanently dimmed so the lighting for the photos would be top-notch. I spent the month being buried under likes and comments.

My eyes were moths attracted to my screen, and nothing else mattered.

It was a warm afternoon and the sun bathed the calm lake. My nose was buried into my phone. Pip skipped behind me, swinging her arms happily. "Nice weather, isn't it?" She commented, letting the wind blow her choppy brown hair.

"Mm," I mumbled.

Pip poked me and I grunted. She shook me. "Go away," I muttered, staring at the screen. Pip rose her eyebrows; I couldn't tell that I had hurt her feelings. Pip huffed and marched away. When I looked up, Pip was gone.

The Gift

There it was. A petite box in the corner of my room wrapped in ribbon. It could've been a dream. There was a gift. Just for me. I slipped out of bed and peered through the curtain. It was still dark, and the sky was a canvas of dark strokes dotted with twinkling stars.

I gently pulled back the curtains and let the silver moonlight bathe my room. Then, I cautiously scurried over to the gift and picked it up.

It was heavy. I gasped loudly as the weight yanked me down. It felt like I was holding the world inside of the little present. I heaved it over to my bed and slowly placed it on the bed. "Should I open it?" I whispered. I sat next the gift and traced the edges with a pale and trembling finger.

I gazed around my bleak room. I wondered what colour the walls were. I signed and looked out to the moon, wondering if the moon was actually yellow.

I could only see the silver moonlight bathing me in soft hues of grey.

My eyes flitted back to the gift.

The gift that sat next to me, waiting patiently for me to open it. My fingers fumbled to open it. It was made of a smooth thin, yet strangely strong material. I finally managed to hook my fingers under the lid and pried it open.

I didn't know what to expect.

I saw something glint. It was glinting like I had never saw anything glint. It sparkled and danced before my eyes. I blinked. My breathing quickened like an accelerating car.

Colour.

Sparks flying from the gift.

Bursting with colour.
