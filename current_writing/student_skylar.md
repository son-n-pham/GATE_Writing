Quit Horsing Around

"Here," I said thrusting a rolled up hay bale in front of the horse.

He examined it, peering over his imaginary glasses like a scientist. His eyebrows dipped down in anger.

"Pip," He demanded, "Quit horsing around. I like apples."

He pointed an accusing hoof at me. I rolled my electric blue eyes. I shouldn't have let the horse wear an ugly sweater in the first place. I couldn't stand living with a horse who thought he was a human.

"Honestly, horses eat hay so please eat up. I even made it look like a cinnamon roll," I said.

The horse snorted angrily and uses his sticky tongue like a launchpad, propelling the hay until it knocked down a beautiful porcelain jar engraved with neat flowers.

He bared his big and flat teeth. I groaned and stormed off. I could still hear the horse yelling, "QUIT HORSING AROUND!"

I ran out to the garden and kicked a tree. Thump. I looked around and saw juicy red apples falling down around me like rain.

Apples.

The ones that horses like. I scooped them up until my arms were full and hurried to the horse. He perked up immediately like a dog.

"Quit horsing around and clean up your mess," I stated, keeping a firm hold on the apples. "And then apples," I added, taking a big bite of a big scarlet apple.

I let the juice dribble down my chin. The horse grumbled and shuffled over to the broken porcelain jar. I felt good. Maybe having a horse-human wasn't so bad after all.
