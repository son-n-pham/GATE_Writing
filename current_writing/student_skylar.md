"Human." The robot said, its voice cold and hard, "We would like to negotiate."

I wrinkled my nose, however, I resisted the urge to rudely insult them.

"How," I replied in a measured voice. On my lap, my fists clenched. If these bug-like robots dressed in business suits wanted peace then they shouldn't have kidnapped me at all.

I took a deep breath. I was the manager of the committee. I was born to stop the war. I sighed. I had to listen to the infamous robot council anyways.

I watched as giant robots stomped outside, flattening humans like bugs. I could taste the acrid scent of smoke lingering on my tongue. I wanted to block out the horrible world I lived in.

But I couldn't. I could only stop it.

"Robots are running out of batteries," a gold robot said, not a hint of sadness in its words.

I bit my lip to stop myself from yelling. "You said you wanted to negotiate," I pushed.

A strange triangular robot slapped his hand on the table. Its mouth opened and a flood of flat talk came out.

"You want us to forfeit..." I mutter.

My face was blank, but inside, my insides writhed with fury. We had to be allowed to cling onto the little string of hope left, the little strand of dignity. My job was to thicken it until it was a win.

We would never work for robots. Never.
