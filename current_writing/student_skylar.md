The page was inches from my nose. I read the words intently and a 3D movie formed like magic pixie dust before my eyes, which were wide as saucers. I absentmindedly traced my finger along the dusty books on the shelf, each one waiting patiently to be opened.

Meanwhile, the movie seemed to be closing in on me, and I soaked it all in like a thirsty sponge. My shaky fingers shakily flipped the page, and the world shuddered. The neatly printed words danced before my startled eyes, weaving themselves into intricately detailed images, every inch of it vivid and clear.

I could feel myself being pulled into the pages of the book by a strange, foreign force. My arms flopped and I whirled through space and time like a rocket.

And then I smelled something. I looked around. I had landed. I was sitting on a hard, wooden chair, standing large and proud at the head of a long polished table lined with steaming bowls of delicious porridge.

I shifted on the chair, and instantly, stabs of pain shot up, clogging my thoughts. "This chair is so hard!" I yelped and shot up like an electrocuted cat. I tried the next chair, it was thick and very soft. As soon as I sat on it I sank like a rock in a pool. I screamed in terror and clawed at the edges of the chair until I finally managed to pull myself onto the arm rest and flop on the ground, panting heavily. "This chair is too soft!"

And then I saw it. A wooden chair with a soft velvet cushion and little blue wheels. I scrambled over and sat myself down, breathing a sigh of relief. "Just right," I cooed.

I scanned the table at the porridge bowls. I tried them all. The biggest bowl was sprinkled with onion and the smell was so sweet my nose tingled. I grinned and took a big spoon of cold. "Too cold!" The sudden pang sent me shaking as I tried to spit out the cold and bitter taste. The second one scalded my tongue like fire and made me overwhelmingly dizzy.

I was about to give up until I spotted a third bowl. It was smaller and it was blue, decorated with cute yellow ducklings. I hurried over and took a cautious sip.

Delicious.

The rest came oozing down my throat and my stomach was filled with warm porridge. I belched and rubbed my stomach, the best meal ever. I laughed, the porridge seemed to slowly radiate out waves.

The room was spinning like crazy, and all was a faint echo of a distant voice. "Sue," it said. "Sue."

My eyes opened like a light being switched on. I sat up. The chairs and the table were gone. I was back where I had started, except I was under a pile of books. I peeled a book off - Goldilocks and the three bears. Was it my imagination?
