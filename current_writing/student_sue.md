I think I might have lived in the trees, once upon a time I could still imagine them, great boughs stretching far and wide, some thin and protruding from the ground like a great stick; Others huge, twisting for the sky with branches thickly knotted and knobbly like a tangle of old rope, brimming with green.

Green. Such a nice colour. I wouldn't have believed it existed if I couldn't see it from the bars of my cage, out in the other place. The place deemed "outside". It was the colour of grass and leaves and plants, the colour of my human girl's eyes.

"Good morning," the girl would tell me every morning the sun's rays reached through my window, hair scruffy like downy tail feathers.

"Good morning," I would say back. This always seemed to please her; she would stroke my beak and give me seeds while the larger human's backs were turned.

I wanted to see more of it, though. This green. The elusive blue.

I didn't nearly see enough blue, only the barest patch was seldom visible if I bobbed my head at the right angle.

My wings ached from being drawn in for so long; I would often stretch them out, flexing the pale yellow feathers, dulled and darkened, brushing the edges of my constraints.

Each day was the same. I ate, I slept. I was stared at, stroked, talked to. I always listened like the good bird I was, though could not make sense of the strings of garble that fell out of the girl's mouth.

I never liked loud voices. The girl wasn't loud, she seemed to understand I did not like to be crept up on.

She grew taller, larger, towering over me like a great giant.

I don't know how much time had passed, but I remember the day she took me out.

The cage was picked up, swinging alarmingly. I clung very still to the branch, stuck stubborn like a twig, afraid to fall.

Outside was different. So, impossibly large.

The sights greeted me, an endless blanket of pure blue, stretching far as my eyes could see. There was so much green, branches, dappled ferns, trees high and graceful, reaching for the clouds.

The cage door opened.

The girl was smiling, I could see the whites of her teeth; yet there seemed something else about her.

"Go on," she said.

I moved on instinct, wings flaring out to their full extent. I stepped out of the cage, felt the rush of air.

The feathers responded fanning out. The wind was under me all around me and everything was blue, blue! I flew.

The girl was a blot far below, still smiling. I beat my great wings as she swung a leg onto her bike and followed, watching me spiral through the sky; air currents buffeting me along, welcoming me like an old friend.

I made a sound, a real one, all of my own and not human speech. She was still watching me as I climbed higher higher, feeling the warmth of the light as I reached out to touch the sun. She laughed, somewhere far down.

For once, the sound did not startle me.

"You're FREE NOW!" She called after me, now only a speck.

Free. I think I like that word.
