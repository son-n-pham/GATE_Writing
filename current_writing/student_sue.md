It all started with the milk.

The milk was sour, burning like acid on my tongue and stinking of foot cheese. That was when Mr Chiron knew the milk had gone bad. It had been fine the day before, but now it wasn't even the expiry date wasn't until two more weeks.

Mr Chiron threw the carton of spoiled milk into the bin, like any other person would. He closed his new fridge and pulled open the glass sliding door of his new house. He fed his dog, a great shaggy German Sheppard. The dog barked as he arrived, a low growl starting from the back of its throat. Its tail whipped back and forth but Mr Chiron did not realise. He filled the water bowl and went back inside.

It was Sunday, and he was off work. He sat down, put on his reading glasses and began the slow and tedious work of reading television instruction manuals. He'd broken it recently, and he wasn't sure how to fix it. The armchair was hard as rock under his weight, and as much as he shifted he could not get comfortable.

Mr Chiron did not notice the lamplight flickering, or the faint silhouette of his reflection moving in the dead television screen.

A cold prickle started at the back of his neck like droplets of ice dripping. Drip. Drip.

When Mr Chiron was younger, he'd wanted to be an explorer. That was until he realised the cost of boats and planes, and realised that quite a lot had been discovered already. He'd dreamed of jungles and castles and treasure. As he grew, the dream quietly slipped away, draining through the cracks of his mind.

Now, he lives alone with his dog, works in an office and struggles to fix broken things in his free time.

Outside, the shadows lengthen as the sun dips. His dog begins to howl.

Mr Chiron gets up, a flicker of annoying lighting. He goes outside to silence his dog.

Mr Chiron doesn't notice the loosening sensation that pools around his ankle, or feel the lightening of a load.

His shadow silently slips away, a moving shroud.

The dog claws at the shed door, paws scratching the wood.

Mr Chiron opens the shed door. The dog whines.

Mr Chiron doesn't see the castle in the sky, shaped from clouds.
