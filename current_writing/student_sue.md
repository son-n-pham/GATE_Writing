Tick. Tick. Tick.

His fingers skipped over the keys like clockwork, notes flowing as they vibrated into the room. This piano was a nice one, a sleek, dark work of wood and polish, gleaming under the golden floodlights.

The audience was silent, eyeing him in almost-captivation as the music rippled in waves, eddying in a circle and flooding outwards. Shorter, quick staccatos, plinking softly. He imagined them as stars, twinking into existence, and out again.

The light was too bright on the underside of his wrists, blinding his vision. There was an in-between state where his mind felt as if it had severed from his body. He was watching, a different set of arms, fingers moving on their accord, racing against each other. Which would go the fastest? They were like spiders, scrambling frantically for purchase.

He observed this dimly as he moved on instinct, muscle memory but not quite. It had become such an ingrained part of him, the piano an extension of his body that he no longer had to concentrate; he could sit back and let his hands do the work. They played and he half-listened, thoughts wandering in erratic strands separated from the rope. Floating, weightless.

He had first learned the piano when he was younger, he thought. Barely a toddler, chubby fists that could no more squeeze a toy than conduct the keys. He wrote things, streams of notes and meaningless words, andante, adagio, largo, they would become a life of its own.

He was always writing something, scribbling a bit of music on paper. He wrote like his life depended on it, like he was running out of time, the constant tick of the clock, the ringing of bells and grinding cogs always in his head. A song, another, twelve, twenty, the list went on.

He stopped everything else entirely, it was him and the piano, the music and nothing else existed. The ticking never ceased, quickening, a physical part of him louder than his own pulse. He lived on the beat, the rhythm that never stopped.

He stopped all else entirely, absorbed himself in music. He played, and people listened. He wasn’t a singer; he played and that was all it did. The thrill of the keys had consumed him, pulled him in.

His hands moved faster, wrist flicking maniacally, racing away from him, away and away, trying to escape the clock that was always ticking, always watching. It consumed him; what was he without it?

He was neck deep in it and unable to dig his way out. Would he back out of it if he could? His pieces became famous, were played on the radio, concerts that garnered audiences of thousands. They were replayed, looped over classical radio stations, reached millions of views online.

He tried to look back, sometimes. Re-track. Follow the string, see where the trail had originally stemmed from.

His songs sounded strange when played backward, a particularly avid fan had posted a playlist compiled of such music. It had garnered thousands of views. The notes were twisted, seeping, sliding. It sounded almost mad the way the keys spiralled, slipping on its on tail.

The thing was, he couldn’t replay real life. Not really. Not if he tried. Would he try?

The stars were still blinking, the clock still ticking.

Tick.
