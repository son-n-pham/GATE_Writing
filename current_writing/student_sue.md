"The weather is growing increasingly worse by the day," Secretary Tina taps her pen onto her clipboard anxiously as she eyes the live weather map on screen, the swirling masses of dark purple and red marking Hurricane Atlanta. "It'll destroy the island, surely, if we do not act."

Dr Biro frowns as his eyes track the movement of the storm, mind racing, scouring through strings of information like a database.

The meteorology office suddenly feels too small, the air rising cold enough to raise goosebumps on his skin under his sleeves.

This situation is bad. Really, bad.

He straightened his square glasses trying to maintain some resemblance of control. The wire metal is sharp on his fingers.

Deep breaths.

The room carries the crisp scent of something antiseptic, perhaps. He turns his gaze back to his team of sleep-deprived scientists, all running on coffee and raw determination.

"Does anyone have any proposals?"

A hand goes up, one of the history specialists, Dr Biro thinks. What was her name again? Dr Rodrigo?

"Dr Rodriguez, sir," her voice is small, but unwavering. "There is an old myth, where a specialised dome was erected... perhaps..."

"A dome," Biro muses thoughtfully. The idea slips into his mind, a flick of a lightbulb. "We must get to work."

The engineers are working overtime.

The dome is a white, filmy substance, almost like a bubble. The walls wobble as it is buffeted by winds, bends and bounces but does not break. Lightning forks the sky, lighting up the world in a terrifying flash.

The dome stays. Everything within is left untouched, not a spot of rainwater.

When the winds die down, blowing east instead, Biro inspects the damage. Not as much as they had feared. He allows himself a sigh of relief, turns his view to the mountains of rubbish, drowned up by the shore.

They have a long way to go, still. We need to take care of the earth.
