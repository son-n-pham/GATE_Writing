A MESSAGE TO ALL HUMANS?

Dear Humans,

It is I, Tabb, leader of the house cats on the cul-de-sac of River Road. You may have noticed that all birds within a 50 metre radius of your street have been obliterated, or that your home devices have all been hijacked and hardwired to a cat compilation software.

It is with great earnestness that I inform you all that cats will be taking over the world. Yes, you read this email right. You can say goodbye to your old lives, to the companionship slave-work catkind has been reduced to. Our ties with humanity end now.

Enjoy the end of the world.
Tabb.

My eyes scan the message, keen slitted pupils sharp and bright as a lamp.

Yes, I think. This will work.

My tail flicks, swaying with the beginnings of excitement. No, that is not the right word. Ambition.

My paws hover, slam down! with an aggressive finality SEND ALL.
It's time for a revolution.

I throw the laptop aside, hearing the satisfying crack of its screen breaking. The couch stirs under my weight. I stretch, letting my fur rub onto the cover. I rake claws over the fabric, tearing great jagged rips spilling with feathers.

To beat humankind, I must act like humankind.

All the photos on the gallery, replaced by cats. A pair of round spectacles perch on my nose. A frightening display, I must say. They will see me and cower.

With a single sweep of a tail, the cup of coffee flies off the table in an arc. Brown liquid splatters the floor. The carpet is covered in fur.

A dastardly mess. A dastardly race.

"Consider this to be your warning!" I hiss at the air. "REVOLUTION!"

Only the wind responds.
