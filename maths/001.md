### Short Answer Questions

1. Joe's wage for 3 days is equal to Peter's wage for 2 days. The sum of Joe's wage for 7 days and Peter's wage for 8 days is $684. How much is Joe's daily wage?

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Let's say Joe's daily wage is $x

   - Then Peter's daily wage is \[\frac{3}{2}x\]
   - Because 3 days of Joe's wage = 2 days of Peter's wage

2. From the second condition:

   - Joe's 7 days + Peter's 8 days = $684
   - 7x + 8(\[\frac{3}{2}x\]) = 684
   - 7x + 12x = 684
   - 19x = 684

3. Therefore:
   - x = $36

Joe's daily wage is $36
