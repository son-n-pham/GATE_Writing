## Grading for student_mang_1.md

### Write in a proper structure (2 marks)

- 2 marks: The writing is well-organised with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The story flows logically from the cat entering the house to interacting with the owner and finally finding happiness.

### Choose a tone to match the theme of the writing (2 marks)

- 2 marks: The tone is generally playful and matches the theme of a cat's curiosity, but it could be more consistent. There are moments where the tone shifts slightly. For example, the description of the owner as "dormant" and "glaring" creates a slightly different tone than the rest of the story.

### Include emotions and feelings (1 mark)

- 1 mark: Emotions and feelings are clearly expressed, adding depth to the narrative. For example, Max's curiosity is evident when he tries to leap onto the chair and when he attempts to use the glasses and keyboard. The owner's surprise and eventual amusement are also well-conveyed.

### Use precise words or phrases (0.5 mark)

- 0.5 marks: The essay uses some precise words, such as "pristine," "vacated," "succulent," and "geriatric," which add detail to the descriptions. However, there are also some vague phrases that could be more specific.

### Use at least THREE figurative languages (1 mark)

- 1 mark: The essay uses one example of figurative language: "like a flow of water gushing down a cliff." More figurative language is needed to enhance the writing.

### Have a moral (Goal to focus on) (1 mark)

- 1 mark: The story clearly conveys a moral or lesson about finding happiness and love in simple things, and that a cat can find a nice life.

### Write with an outstanding idea (2 marks)

- 2 marks: The narrative is creative and engaging, with a cat interacting with a laptop and a statue, but it could be more original. The idea of the cat using the keyboard is interesting, but the overall plot could be more unique.

### TOTAL MARKS: 9.5/14 (68%)

### Strengths:

- Clear structure with a logical flow.
- Good expression of emotions and feelings.
- Some precise word choices.

### Areas for Improvement:

- Tone could be more consistent throughout the story.
- Needs more examples of figurative language. Try to include at least three examples in your next writing.
- The plot could be more original and unique.

### Overall Assessment:

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of narrative structure and emotional expression. However, it needs improvement in tone consistency, figurative language usage, and originality. The student should focus on incorporating more literary devices and developing more unique plot ideas in future writings.
