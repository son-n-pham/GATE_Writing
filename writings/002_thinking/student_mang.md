Twilight filled the grief consumed corridor, cleared of any sign indicating
colour, light or life. The wind whistled through the towering pillars creating only sound, able to be heard.
A man stood in the colourless plane, unable to move or think.
Attempting to imagine a world of life and luxury was eternally out of reach, like a goal with no prize. The mind was a fascinating entity, its capabilities endless, yet also enhanced with a limit, like a long string tied to a burning match, the power of imagination just needed to be cut loose.

The man who stood in the corridor seemed to be a representation of thought, yet unable to be cut free, with an unrippable rope. Like a candle in a head, the corridor could bring back to a flourishing future, sunshine and a golden treasure, all returned with just a flicker of fire. Yet it could also be blown out with a single dull thought of mind. Doubt and demons could chase the man out, but only if you don't believe in yourself.

The man could cry, drowned in tears or have some fun with the chase, overflowing with cheer. Yet fear, fright, and discouragement could overcome both fates, undermining the power of oversight. You could think something easy, but turns out to be hard, like smoke in the corridor that slowly overcomes all.

Though each little representation of the mind is different in each way, remember a string, candle or smoke could help unlock your minds true potential. You could write a fable, imagine an epic fight. For imagination is endless and its power is true.
