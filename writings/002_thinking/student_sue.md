Thoughts are a strange thing.

They drift and flow without ceasing for a moment in a loop, chasing tail ends and shifting from one topic to the next, fluid as a shapeshifter.

Sometimes, I like to ponder in colours. Blue isn't sad as some may say, although it rather depends on the exact shade. Greyer, muted blues speak of rainy days and murky emotions. Perhaps sadness falls into that spectrum. Bright blues, electric, cerulean are like the sky on a clear summer's day. Blazing in its completeness. Pale blue sounds of infants and clouds and little pastel booties. Colours feel and see.

On some days, my mind is a canvas blank of all but one colour, other days it is streaked or speckled or mottled or striped like a rainbow, fuzzy around the edges.

Thoughts come and go, sometimes lazily, a turtle eyeing me with vague interest as it floats by. Sometimes swift, striking, an overwhelming flood that breaks down the carefully constructed dams around my mind. It crashes and I almost can imagine it leaking, a dripping of a tap.

But in truth, moments like these do not happen often, at least to me. When I think, it is steady as a surgeon's hand, curving gently in loops and rises that always meet in the centre as a circle. Circles are reliable, infinite.

Perhaps I am sentient; perhaps I am not. Perhaps my thoughts are all but strings of data that stream, flows of information. The sky is blue. Blue is sad. Blue is not. I am leaking. Methodical.

The pen moves, capturing every word that comes, unbidden. I think. It loops. I write. Words spill.
