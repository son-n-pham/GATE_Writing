## Marking Rubric

### Write in a proper structure (2 marks)

- **2 marks**: The writing is well-organised with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The story begins by setting the scene of the king's dissatisfaction with the current float, moves into the conflict between the builders, and ends with a question that propels the narrative forward.

### Choose a tone to match the theme of the writing (3 marks)

- **2 marks**: The tone is generally appropriate for the initial conflict, with a slightly humorous feel when describing the teams arguing ("The king watches them fight like little kids"). However, while the introduction of spying attempts to bring in the "Mystery & Suspense" theme, it could be further emphasized throughout the narrative to fully align with the prompt.

### Include emotions and feelings (1 mark)

- **1 mark**: Emotions and feelings are clearly expressed. For instance, the king's frustration is evident in the exclamation, ""I need a new float!"". The scruffy man's anger is also shown with the description, ""His head is now a blur of red hot lava"".

### Use precise words or phrases (1 mark)

- **0.5 marks**: The writing uses some precise and descriptive language, such as ""brown woodplank on wheels"" to depict the boring float and ""eyes go as wide as saucers"" to illustrate the girl's surprise. However, there are instances where more specific language could be used, like referring to ""another group of people"" which lacks detail.

### Use at least THREE figurative languages (3 marks)

- **3 marks**: The essay effectively incorporates three examples of figurative language:
  - Simile: ""The king watches them fight like little kids."" This comparison helps visualize the childish nature of the argument.
  - Simile: ""Her eyes go as wide as saucers"". This vividly describes the girl's reaction to being spotted.
  - Metaphor: ""His head is now a blur of red hot lava as the desire of winning the king's favour takes over him."" This powerful metaphor conveys the intensity of his ambition.

### Have a moral (Goal to focus on) (1 mark)

- **0 marks**: At this stage, the story does not explicitly convey a moral or lesson. This could be something to develop further as the narrative progresses.

### Write with an outstanding idea (3 marks)

- **2 marks**: The narrative presents a creative and engaging idea with the two teams competing to build a float and resorting to spying. The concept of the Hollywood theme being a secret adds an element of intrigue. However, the idea could be further developed with more intricate plot points and character motivations.

### TOTAL MARKS: 10.5/14 (75%)

### Strengths:

- Clear and organized structure with a beginning, middle, and end.
- Effective use of figurative language to create vivid imagery.
- Engaging idea with the introduction of competing teams and spying.

### Areas for Improvement:

- **Enhance the tone to fully match the "Mystery & Suspense" theme:** Consider adding more suspenseful elements, perhaps by hinting at the consequences of the spying or creating more tension in the interactions between the teams.
- **Use more precise language:** Replace vague phrases with more specific and descriptive words to paint a clearer picture for the reader. For example, instead of "another group of people," describe their appearance or role.
- **Develop a clear moral or lesson:** Think about what message you want the reader to take away from the story and weave it into the narrative.

### Overall Assessment:

Skylar's essay demonstrates a good understanding of narrative structure and incorporates creative elements. The use of figurative language is a strong point. To further enhance the writing, focusing on developing a consistent tone that aligns with the prompt's theme, using more precise language, and incorporating a clear moral will elevate the essay to a higher level. The foundation for a compelling story is present, and with further development, it can become even more engaging and impactful.
