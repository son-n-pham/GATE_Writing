Spies

The king's float for the parade sits in front of the royal family. With just two days to go, the float is bare and boring.

"I need a new float!" He cries when he sees the brown woodplank on wheels in front of him.

"We'll make it!" shout a team of builders all wearing bright green shirts with steel capped boots.

"No, we will!" declare another group of people in orange vests.

The king watches them fight like little kids.

"You each can make one and I'll decide which one is better." He decides.

The green team huddle together and discuss what they're going to make.

"Lets make it hollywood themed." A sly man with a grey scruffy beard whispers. He turns around to check if they were spied on and spots a little blonde girl in a bright orange vest hiding behind a large book just a bench away from them! Her eyes go as wide as saucers and she dashes away back to her team.

"Spies," the scruffy man hisses. "Two can play that game."

His head is now a blur of red hot lava as the desire of winning the king's favour takes over him.

"At this rate," someone says, "when will we ever finish the float?"
