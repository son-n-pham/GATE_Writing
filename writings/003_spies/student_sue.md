"I think I'm being watched," I hiss out of the corner of my mouth, trying to aim the words at the microphone clipped to my collar.

A crackle sounds in my left earbud radio that makes me wince.

"Copy that. How many?" The volume is up a notch too high. I pretend to scratch my head, lifting the book up higher and fiddling surreptitiously with the sound button.

"Bush at 3 o'clock moved," I whisper, tilting the book sideways to peer out of the carefully camouflaged peep-hole at the suspicious bush.

It rustles. I stare hard at it.

"You sure it's not the breeze?" Something shifts on the other end of the line.

"Sure," I mutter.

The plastic red "100% recycled" park bench creaks as I move. I turn slowly, lifting my gaze back to the road. I only have one job, and I won't let the spies ruin it. Eyes on the prize.

My disguise must be good because no one has approached me yet. I nudge my bag closer. Just a precaution.

Another rustle, behind me. My pulse spikes. Without moving my head, I flick my eyes over to my left.

A blur. Something ducks. I catch a glimpse of dark shades flashing in the sun. Shades. Sunglasses.

Crap.

I press a finger to my microphone, "Code Yellow! They've foundâ€”"

A black car screams down the road, billowing exhaust fumes. The click of camera lens. Crap! Not again!

I snatch my bag by the cuffs of the arm strap. The book falls to the ground. Its pages are blank.

Someone lunges out of the bushes, eyes shadowed by sleek black shades. Hands reaching for me. Crap!

I dodge.

Another bush shakes. A fellow co-conspirator! Just as I had suspected! Crap!

I run. A root blocks my path. I trip. Why isn't my radio working?

The bag is torn from my shoulder. Its contents spill out, a water bottle, a banana peel, a flag. Damn my clumsiness!

Someone grabs it before I can. The announcements blare.

"TEAM BLUE WINS CAPTURE THE FLAG!"

Crap. Not again.
