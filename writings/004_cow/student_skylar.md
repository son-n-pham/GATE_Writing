"This milk is so sour!" Farmer Jack me groaned. He scratched his long shaggy beard. His sweaty forehead so creased. He looked around of his maze of a shed that was filled with strange machines, beeping and buzzing and stacks of planning papers. He had tried so hard to create the only sweet milk in the whole town. It had resulted worse than the original sour milk. A few bubbles sizzled around the glass of milk in Farmer Jack's callowed hand, making him feel insulted like the bad milk was laughing.

In a sudden fit of rage, Farmer Jack threw the milk on the floor and stormed out of his shed. He stomped over to the barn where he glared stormily at the cows which looked up at him with sad eyes. Jack tried to calm himself down. He slowed his breaths and gently closed his eyes like he was meditating. He thought of the thing that calmed him down the most - his cello!

Carefully taking it out of a small cupboard, Jack brushed dirt off of his dusty overalls and sat down resting the marvelous instrument on his shoulder. Farmer Jack worked his magic, playing fast and lively tunes. His bow was moving so fast it was merely a blur! Farmer Jack stared at his cows opened mouthed. The cows were bopping to the music!

Their white heads raised and in time to the music! The sadness in their eyes had evaporated, replaced by bright little spots. "Eureka!" Farmer Jack shrieked!

Now, Farmer Jack happily milks his cows by a little group of double doors. His cows are happy so the milk is pure and sweet! His delicious milk became popular throughout the world and all of his lucky cows danced and ate all night. Alongside Farmer Jack and the band of cellos.
