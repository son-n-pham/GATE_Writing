The music swirls, the low, warm drawl of pulled horse-hair dragging across strings, vibrating deep and mellow. My ears flick as if to ward off the noise, hay dry and a tasteless crackle of stalks against my teeth. The others shift on their hooves beside me, swaying discretely with the backdrop of humming strings, mouths working monotonously, tearing up the dead grasses.

The air is hot, uncomfortably so among the close proximity of furred hides pressing together. There are five of them gathered in a vague, open semicircle, lips pulled in upturned smiles, leering, drawing those bows back and forth, back and forth, omitting the thrumming keen that drops and lifts and loops around in a lazy, dizzying display of sound.

I paw the ground with my hooves, let out a low moan that they fail to take as a call of distress. All heads are down, eyes on the hay. The cellos groan. Are they pleased with themselves? Human emotions are difficult to read.

They are dressed differently - clean, pressed pieces of fabric in black and white and red. What do they think they are, magpies? At least magpies have a sense of dignity.

I moan again. The last human, male, I observe, lets out a sound, rather like barking but faster, with a more unstable rhythm. A note screeches. His teeth are white as his mouth stretches in an unpleasant crescent shape. The music continues.

I crunch on the stalks. I would charge and plow down the humans and their awful stringed instruments if I could, but my back leg is shackled to the wall. My eyes are on the ground. I just need to wait. Wait for the signal.

The music picks up, tumbling over itself. My ears catch the warble of a crow. At the end of the barn, the hay stacks begin to fall.
