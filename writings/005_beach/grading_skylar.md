### Write in a proper structure (2/2):

The writing is well-organised with a clear introduction describing the setting, a body detailing the interaction with the jellyfish, and a conclusion about leaving the beach.

### Choose a tone to match the theme of the writing (3/3):

The tone is consistently lighthearted and joyful, perfectly matching the theme of a fun family outing at the beach. For example, phrases like "giggling madly" and "grinning from wet ear to wet ear" effectively convey the happy mood.

### Include emotions and feelings (1/1):

Emotions and feelings are clearly expressed throughout the narrative. The excitement of spotting jellyfish and the joy of playing in the water are palpable. The phrase "I laugh so hard I go with her" clearly shows the enjoyment.

### Use precise words or phrases (0.5/1):

The writing uses some precise words like "azure bucket" and "muddy sand squelches," which add vividness. However, some descriptions could be more specific. For instance, instead of just "pink sky," you could describe the specific shades or how the colors blend.

### Use at least THREE figurative languages (2/3):

Two examples of figurative language were used: "the sky rose is a canvas of thick salmon pink strokes" (metaphor) and "eyes large and round like a hopeful puppy's" (simile). Try to incorporate one more instance of figurative language to enhance your descriptions further.

### Have a moral (Goal to focus on) (0/1):

The story does not explicitly convey a moral or lesson. While it depicts a pleasant family moment, there isn't a clear takeaway message or reflection on a broader theme. Consider what message or lesson you want your reader to gain from the story.

### Write with an outstanding idea (2/3):

The narrative is creative and engaging, depicting a relatable family moment at the beach. The focus on "jelly fishing" is a fun and unique element. However, the plot is relatively simple. To make it more outstanding, consider adding a surprising twist, a unique challenge, or a more complex interaction between the characters.
