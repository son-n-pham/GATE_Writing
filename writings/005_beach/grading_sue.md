### Write in a proper structure (2/2):

The writing is well-structured with a descriptive opening, a body that develops the scene and characters, and a reflective conclusion.

### Choose a tone to match the theme of the writing (3/3):

The tone is consistently reflective and slightly melancholic, perfectly matching the serene yet subtly poignant atmosphere of the beach scene at sunset. The narrator's internal thoughts contribute to this tone effectively.

### Include emotions and feelings (1/1):

Emotions and feelings are subtly yet effectively conveyed. The narrator's concern for the children and her internal conflict about what to tell them add emotional depth to the piece. The line "But I am not their mother, and the news will only bring them distress" poignantly expresses her feelings.

### Use precise words or phrases (1/1):

The writing employs precise and evocative language throughout. Phrases like "rosy sheen," "prim and straight-backed," and "fingers are stiff with salt" create vivid imagery and contribute to the overall atmosphere.

### Use at least THREE figurative languages (3/3):

The essay effectively uses more than three examples of figurative language: "sun is a pale white circle against the hazy clouds, light and soft as rose petals" (simile), "sand is like dirt, dark, purplish streaks against the water" (simile), "The world is round as an orange" (simile), and "Flat as a stingray" (simile).

### Have a moral (Goal to focus on) (1/1):

The story subtly conveys a moral about the complexities of protecting innocence and the weight of unspoken truths. The narrator's decision to withhold information to avoid distressing the children suggests a reflection on the burdens and responsibilities of caregiving.

### Write with an outstanding idea (3/3):

The narrative presents an outstanding idea by hinting at a deeper, unspoken issue or context that adds layers of meaning to the seemingly simple scene. This creates intrigue and invites the reader to consider the underlying circumstances and the narrator's motivations.
