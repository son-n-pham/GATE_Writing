Jelly fishing

The water feels cool under my bare feet. Above me, the sky rose is a canvas of thick salmon pink strokes. The whispering wind ruffles my dark hair as muddy sand squelches through my toes. A little azure bucket swings at my side as I sprint through the water. Pip walks in front of me, her blonde ponytail swinging gently. I splash in the water and mum laughs. She holds a green net and her warm amber eyes twinkle, reflecting the setting sun.

"Jelly fish!" I shriek and dive into the water. I return pink-faced with wet hair plastered to my forehead but nevertheless giggling madly. Pip turns around to scold me but I lift my bucket and dunk a squishy white jellyfish onto her immaculately brushed hair. She shrieks and topples over into the water. I laugh so hard I go with her.

Before we know it, we are up again and both grinning from wet ear to wet ear. Mum chuckles softly.

"We'd better be going now," Mum says softly after a while.

The sun is sinking ever lower in the pink sky. Me and Pip groan.

"Can I bring Jello with me?" I ask my eyes large and round like a hopeful puppy's.

Mum sighs but gives in. Me and Pip rejoice joining hands and dancing around Jello and his little azure bucket.

"I love jelly fishing," I sigh dreamily as I gaze at Jello.
