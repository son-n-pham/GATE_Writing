Their feet patter down against the wash of pink and gold reflected on the flooded sand, the flat landscape awash, blushing a rosy sheen as far as the eye can see. Boats splash, whipping up flecks of water as Tommy scampers after his sister, freshly picked molluscs rattling in his plastic bucket.

Lisa walks, prim and straight-backed, taking quick, long strides leaving shallow shoeprints in the sand.

The sun is a pale white circle against the hazy clouds, light and soft as rose petals. My fingers are stiff with salt and reddened from a day's work as they clutch the long pole-net.

"Don't go too far!" I call, trying my best to sound stern, motherly. My voice is small and strained as if even that shout had caused it to brush the limits of my vocal range.

The sand is like dirt, dark, purplish streaks against the water reflecting the sunlight lapping gently and leaving trails of barely leaving any foam in its wake.

Tommy cackles, rolling his eyes and making a comment about how everything was so flat, I would be able to see anything a mile away.

"The world is round as an orange," Lisa lifts her head and peers down at Tommy. "It's not flat."

Tommy's face splits into a gap-toothed smile, seaweed showing in his teeth. "Flat as a stingray."

I let them argue. Their chatter fills the empty silence. Even the breeze makes no sound. I scan the endless horizon, the shimmering waves white.

I should tell them to stop. Should tell them the truth, what is real and what is not. But I am not their mother, and the news will only bring them distress.

So I let them run along the rose-streaked shore, until the end of time.
