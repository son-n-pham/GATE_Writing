## Grading for Skylar's Essay

### Write in a proper structure (1.5 marks)

- The writing has a discernible structure with an introduction that sets the scene of a castle, a body that transitions into an argument against becoming a republic, and a conclusion that reiterates this stance. However, the shift in focus from describing the castle to discussing Australian politics is somewhat abrupt, affecting the overall coherence.
- Evidence: The essay starts with descriptive sentences like "Towering above the horizon, reaching up to touch the sky, sits a beautiful white castle," and later transitions to "But that's past," signaling a shift in topic.

### Choose a tone to match the theme of the writing (1.5 marks)

- The tone initially aligns with the theme of a majestic castle ("beautiful white castle, like a crown atop a head"). However, it quickly shifts to an argumentative and somewhat informal tone when discussing the monarchy and the idea of Australia becoming a republic ("It seems downright silly that people are concerned about becoming a republic"). This tonal shift detracts from the initial theme.
- Evidence: The contrast between "Hypnosis castle shines like a star" and "Pure and snobbish monarchy is something we've left behind a long time ago" illustrates the tonal shift.

### Include emotions and feelings (1 mark)

- Emotions are evident in the writing, particularly a sense of pride in Australia's current state and a dismissal of the monarchy. Phrases like "I love Australia the way it is" clearly express personal feelings.
- Evidence: "I love Australia the way it is."

### Use precise words or phrases (0.5 marks)

- The essay uses some precise and evocative language, such as "Towering above the horizon" and "shines like a star." However, there are also instances of less precise or informal phrasing like "scurrying around frantically" and "downright silly."
- Evidence: "Towering above the horizon, reaching up to touch the sky, sits a beautiful white castle" shows precise description, while "downright silly" is less formal.

### Use at least THREE figurative languages (3 marks)

- The essay effectively uses three examples of figurative language:
  - Simile: "beautiful white castle, like a crown atop a head"
  - Simile: "Hypnosis castle shines like a star"
  - Metaphor: "We are already woven into the tapestries"
- Evidence: These phrases clearly employ figurative language to enhance the imagery and convey ideas.

### Have a moral (Goal to focus on) (1 mark)

- The essay conveys a clear moral or lesson: appreciate the present and don't dwell on outdated systems. The argument against becoming a republic serves as the vehicle for this message.
- Evidence: The conclusion emphasizes that "becoming a republic and worrying about castles and horrible kings is a bad idea."

### Write with an outstanding idea (2 marks)

- The narrative presents a somewhat original idea by juxtaposing the image of a fairytale castle with a discussion about modern Australian identity and its relationship with the monarchy. While creative, the connection between the initial description and the subsequent argument could be more seamlessly integrated.
- Evidence: The essay begins with a focus on the castle but transitions to a commentary on Australian politics.

### TOTAL MARKS: 10.5/14 (75%)

### Strengths:

- Effective use of figurative language enhances descriptions.
- Clear expression of personal feelings and opinions.
- Identifiable moral or lesson conveyed through the argument.

### Areas for Improvement:

- Improve structural coherence by ensuring smoother transitions between descriptive and argumentative sections.
- Maintain a consistent tone that aligns with the initial theme of the writing prompt. Consider how the description of the castle could be more deeply connected to the argument about the republic.
- Enhance word precision by replacing informal language with more descriptive and evocative vocabulary throughout the essay.

### Overall Assessment:

Skylar's essay demonstrates a good understanding of figurative language and clearly expresses their viewpoint on the topic. However, the essay could benefit from a more cohesive structure and a more consistent tone that aligns with the initial descriptive theme. Strengthening the connection between the castle imagery and the political argument would also enhance the essay's overall impact.
