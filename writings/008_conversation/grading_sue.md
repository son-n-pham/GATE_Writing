### TOTAL MARKS: 13.5/14 (96.4%)

### Strengths:

- Evocative and reflective tone that suits the narrative.
- Effective use of precise language and figurative language.
- Engaging and original scenario.

### Areas for Improvement:

- Explicitly connect the narrative to the visual prompt (the figures on separate cliffs, the empty speech bubble, the pile of grey bubbles). For instance, the narrator's internal "hole" for the messages could be linked to the pile of grey bubbles.
- Develop a clearer moral or lesson. While the impact of communication is evident, a more defined takeaway could enhance the essay's depth.
- Explore the role of technology in the relationship more explicitly. The reliance on text messages as the sole form of communication could be further analyzed in terms of its limitations and potential for misinterpretation.

### Overall Assessment: Sue's essay is a well-written and engaging narrative that effectively uses tone and language to convey the experience of receiving unwanted messages. The story is original and thought-provoking. To further develop the essay, Sue could explicitly connect the narrative to the visual prompt, develop a clearer moral, and more directly address the role of technology in the communication breakdown.
