How to Make Conversational Friend Rolls

Preparation Time: Varies  
Servings: Infinite

Talking or making friends with someone is hard. If you're shy and elusive, like the rarely-seen snow leopard, it might be extremely difficult to even strike up a conversation. Some people might shy away from being the one to light the match, but it's not easy. Some people tend to just ignore, so here is my easy recipe to cook up a nice, flowing conversation.

Ingredients:
All you need: A little bit of courage, the little lion inside of you.

Method:

1. Find someone you would like to talk to. This could be the person you're sitting next to.

2. Pluck up some courage, take a deep, calm breath, and talk.

3. You might start with saying "hi." Maybe if you've found something in common between you two, you can talk about it like, "Hi Tim! I heard you like skating! I love it too!"

4. The cookies will begin to smell wonderfully. Now, if 'Tim' is ignoring you, you could say, "Excuse me?" If not, let the flower bloom.

5. Make sure you listen. As well as talking, you have to listen. It is quite frustrating when you're talking and 'Tim' is on his phone.

6. After one conversation, you might feel that Tim is your friend. If you truly feel so, take the cookies out of the oven, and you can invite Tim to go and eat together.

7. Enjoy! You have now harnessed the basics of friendship and conversation! Soon, you could have a new best friend that was born from the magic of talking.
