The first message slipped through on the 23rd of August, a chink by the lines of it. I read the message and felt the words wash over me. I was confused at first, I swiped left and deleted it without replying. I think I might have recognised the name, a vague impression.

An old colleague, perhaps, or a classmate. I tried to think back, to place the person.

Janine Mendoza. I remembered her, then. Tall and straightlaced with a curl of dark hair. We were acquaintances, once. Friends would be too strong of a word. I respected her, and her me. I might have fancied her once; I am not sure. Something about her held me back, though. She smiled, but there was always something hiding at the back of her gaze.

It’s been years, now. I wonder how she’s found my number. I’ve grown older, put on a little weight, lost a little hair. I owned a house, I published some books. I was  
flattered to know my novels were so far-reaching they had caught the attention of Janine Mendoza, who was now an editor. I remember her telling me that she  
wished to be a world-famous actress. I suppose that hasn’t carried through.

The text messages piled up in a steady stream, each with a scrap of  
constructive feedback and the rest a swab of scathing remarks. After a while, I stopped reading them altogether, letting them pile up in a hole I mentally constructed, one at the pits of my mind labelled Janine Mendoza.

Her messages grew increasingly frustrated. I didn’t block her number, a part of me  
mildly intrigued to see if it would make her crack and give up once and for all.

The texts have slowed now. I only receive them twice a month.
