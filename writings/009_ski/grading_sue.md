### Write in a proper structure (2 marks)

- **2 marks:** The writing is well-organised with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The introduction sets the scene, the body describes the morning routine and the beginning of the ski trip, and the conclusion ends with a race challenge.

### Choose a tone to match the theme of the writing (3 marks)

- **3 marks:** The tone consistently matches and enhances the theme of the writing. The dialogue and descriptive language create a sense of a winter morning adventure, with a mix of annoyance at being woken up and excitement for the ski trip. For example, "Go away," my voice grumbled, croaky and thick" and "Race you to Summit Three!" effectively convey the tone.

### Include emotions and feelings (1 mark)

- **1 mark:** Emotions and feelings are clearly expressed, adding depth to the narrative. The essay effectively conveys Sue's initial annoyance at being woken up, her reluctance to leave the bed, and her growing excitement for the ski trip.

### Use precise words or phrases (1 mark)

- **1 mark:** Uses clear, specific, and accurate language to convey ideas. The essay uses vivid and precise language, such as "croaky and thick," "sleep-stupid brain," "inky black," "indigo," and "pale and pink like the insides of a shell."

### Use at least THREE figurative languages (3 marks)

- **2 marks:** Uses two examples of figurative language effectively. The essay includes:
  - Simile: "pulling it over my head like a shield"
  - Metaphor: "sky paled to a deep blue, blushing soft pink at the horizon that spread across the white-capped mountaintops like a blanket"

### Have a moral (Goal to focus on) (1 mark)

- **0.5 marks:** The story suggests a moral, but it is not clearly developed. The story hints at the importance of enjoying the moment and adventure, but it could be more explicit.

### Write with an outstanding idea (3 marks)

- **2 marks:** The narrative has some creative elements but is not fully developed. The story is engaging and has a good sense of pace, but it could be more original.
