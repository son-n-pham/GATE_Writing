# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "I see a digital illustration of a winter mountain scene. Two figures on skis are in the foreground. The person on the left is wearing an orange jacket and a blue backpack. The person on the right is wearing a dark green jacket with a red hat, and he is holding a cell phone as if to take a picture. They are both standing on a snow-covered ridge or slope. Behind them, there is a panorama of mountain ranges under a clear sky with a gradient of blue to peach/pink. There are also snow-covered peaks, thin clouds, and ski slopes with cable car tracks. At the bottom right, there are a few chalet-style houses. The illustration uses flat, slightly grainy colors and line art for contours. The colors are primarily cool tones such as shades of blue and white with the addition of peach/pink on the horizon.",
