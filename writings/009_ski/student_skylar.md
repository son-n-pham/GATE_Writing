The mountains are jagged white triangles capped with thick snow. Rosy pink morning sunlight bathes the peaks of the beautiful, treacherous Pocket Mountains. The frigid wind dances around me, ruffling my grey silky fur and making my little golden horns quiver from the bitter cold. Behind me lies the little cozy human village that burned with warmth and cheer: snow-covered roofs and blocked chimneys. Behind the little village was a little ski resort filled with mugs of hot chocolate and cries of joyous laughter.

My keen little eyes darted away from the happy humans and to the highest mountain. The way up is so steep that the only beings that can climb its dangerous rocks are goats, my family. The Kangaroo Mountain is a jagged cone that towers above me, a mountain I am ready to climb.

As I scamper over rocks and through the snow, I know my fate has been locked into place, the envelope sealed. I am no longer the lonely and scraggly baby goat that was found homeless with no family. My eyes narrow in concentration; I am going to join my family soon, I think.

Hours pass. The salmon pink glow is now covered by clouds of doubt. I am hungry, thirsty, tired. Every muscle in my petite and fragile body is aching. My hooves stop moving. I look up. Every breath I take is raspy. My eyes glaze over and stars edge their way into my vision.

"Need some help?" bleats a voice.

I blink the stars away with my long dark eyelashes. I see a shape standing over me. Horns. Four legs. Family. A fellow goat by my side. For the first time in my short life, I'm not alone.
