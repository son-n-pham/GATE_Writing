"I woke to fingers digging in my shoulder, shaking my arm so vigorously I could feel my whole body bobbing to the movement.

Automatically, I swatted the hand off, grabbing the edges of my thick winter blanket and pulling it over my head like a shield. 'Go away,' my voice grumbled, croaky and thick.

The blanket was whipped off, exposing my thin sweater to air. 'Wake up!' I was prodded painfully on the shoulder. 'It's sunrise soon!'

'Sunrise?' My sleep-stupid brain worked sluggishly, turning the words through.

'Ski! Resort!' I was poked again, twice.

Ski... resort... my eyes blinked open, crusty and bleary. A different pair of dark eyes watched impatiently through a face completely obscured with scarves and a thick, woolen beanie.

'Hurry up!' Van's voice was slightly muffled. He pulled on a pair of gloves. 'We'll miss the sunrise!'"

I sat up. My movements were clumsy and slow. I blinked the grit out of my eyes and crawled reluctantly out of the comfort of my bed, reaching for the thermal socks. My breath tasted terrible.

The sky was beginning to lighten from an inky black to an indigo by the time I had pulled on my boots and stepped out the door. Snow crunched satisfyingly soft under my shoes.

I watched as the sky paled to a deep blue, blushing soft pink at the horizon that spread across the white-capped mountaintops like a blanket. I lifted my skis and stepped forward, taking in the view. Van had pulled out his phone and was snapping two pictures a second, the sky reflected in his goggles, beanie lit up to a bright orange as it basked in the new sun's light.

The skiing paths were sparse, lit up pale and pink like the insides of a shell, fresh of tracks after last night's snowfall.

I dug my poles into the ground and pushed off, gliding in a quickening downward slope.

"Race you to Summit Three!"
