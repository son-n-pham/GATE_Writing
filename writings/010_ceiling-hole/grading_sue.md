## Grading for Sue

### Write in a proper structure (2 marks)

- 2 marks: The writing is well-organised with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The introduction sets the scene, the body describes the events, and the conclusion provides a resolution.

### Choose a tone to match the theme of the writing (3 marks)

- 3 marks: The tone consistently matches and enhances the theme of the writing. The calm and detached tone is consistent with the surreal and dreamlike nature of the prompt.

### Include emotions and feelings (1 mark)

- 0.5 marks: Emotions and feelings are mentioned but not well-developed. The narrator mentions feeling "nothing at all" which is a valid emotion, but it could be explored further to add more depth to the narrative.

### Use precise words or phrases (1 mark)

- 1 mark: Uses clear, specific, and accurate language to convey ideas. For example, "near pitch-darkness" and "spiderweb of cracks" are vivid and precise.

### Use at least THREE figurative languages (3 marks)

- 2 marks: Uses two examples of figurative language effectively.
  - "spiderweb of cracks spread, like lines of infection" (simile)
  - "The metal redacted, punched through again. It sawed, drawing and shearing back and forth in sharp breaths." (personification)

### Have a moral (Goal to focus on) (1 mark)

- 0.5 marks: The story suggests a moral, but it is not clearly developed. The story hints at accepting the unexpected, but this could be made more explicit.

### Write with an outstanding idea (3 marks)

- 2 marks: The narrative has some creative elements but is not fully developed. The calm reaction to the bizarre event is interesting, but the story could be more engaging with a more developed plot or character motivations.

### TOTAL MARKS: 11/14 (79%)

### Strengths:

- Strong and consistent tone that matches the theme.
- Clear and precise language with vivid descriptions.
- Good use of figurative language.

### Areas for Improvement:

- Explore emotions more deeply to add more depth to the narrative.
- Develop the moral of the story more clearly.
- Consider adding more engaging plot elements or character motivations.

### Overall Assessment: Sue's essay is a well-written piece that effectively captures the surreal and dreamlike nature of the prompt. The calm and detached tone, along with the use of precise language and figurative language, make it a compelling read. However, the essay could be improved by exploring emotions more deeply, developing the moral more clearly, and adding more engaging plot elements.
