# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "The image depicts a surreal bedroom scene rendered in shades of blue. A man with dark hair and wearing blue overalls stands on a bed, holding a saw and reaching up to a large, jagged opening in the ceiling that reveals a night sky with a crescent moon and stars. The bed is covered in irregularly shaped blocks that look like pieces of a ceiling or wall, and a woman is sitting up in bed, observing him. There is a framed picture on the wall showing three pine trees. A small nightstand with a lamp is in the lower right corner. The style is illustrative and has a slightly naive quality. The overall tone of the image is whimsical and dreamlike.",

    "colors": ["blue", "black", "white"],

     "text": null
     },
  "writing_task_requirements": "The image implies a narrative, asking the writer to explore themes of construction, deconstruction, night, dreams and the interplay between these elements. The student could be prompted to explain the meaning of the image, what is happening or what is about to happen, and the relationship between the characters.",
 "summary": "This image serves as a writing prompt by presenting a bizarre scenario that encourages imaginative storytelling. The opening in the ceiling, the man's actions, the woman's observation, and the scattered blocks all contribute to a sense of unease and a disruption to the normal bedroom setting. It prompts the writer to interpret the symbolic meaning and motivations of the characters and to create a narrative out of this surreal scene. It can inspire stories with themes of dreams, construction, change, or the unexpected."
