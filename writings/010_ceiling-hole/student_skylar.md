Hestia looked around at her little bedroom. It was a modest little room that had everything except a view. Every night she would gaze longingly at the empty space of tedious grey paint. She felt itchy looking at the uneven paint swirls.

Hestia couldn't sleep. She felt like she was trapped in a wooden box. No air, no view. At the same time, she felt irritated that she was so worried about a little petty problem. With a burst of annoyance, she called a builder to build a window.

He came surprisingly quickly, knocking on the front door. He had on blue, dirty overalls, and steel-capped boots. His hair was a black ball of wool glued to his round head.

Hestia led the builder to her room.
"Can you put a window? Some where?" she asked, gesturing around to her.
The builder grinned and rubbed his hands together. Whipping out a vicious-looking saw, he proceeded to cut open the ceiling! Dust danced through the air and rested on Hestia's dark curly hair. Her mouth was opening and closing, but no sound came out.

She gazed up at the hole in the roof. The moonlight bathed her dark skin. The builder looked at her.
"Do you like it?" he asked uncertainly.
"It's weird..." Hestia whispered hoarsely. "But it's wonderful!"
The stars twinkled above her. The moon glowed against the canvas of midnight black that was the sky. Hestia couldn't have asked for a better view.
"Thank you," she said.
