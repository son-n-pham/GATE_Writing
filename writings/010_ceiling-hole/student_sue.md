I think I had the most peculiar dream. The room was clean, well-made as always. The bed was a touch too stiff against my back, the pillows flat, the blanket thin. It was hot; I was wearing a sleeveless blouse and had pulled my hair back into a loose braid for the night. I really didn’t need the blanket, but an old childish superstition had crept up on me since I was young, claiming that if I were to sleep with covers off, a monster would crawl under the door and lop off my toes. It was an irrational thought, but one I followed nevertheless.

The bed was large and empty. I was waiting for my husband to return from his late shift. My eyes strained in the near pitch-darkness; my room had no windows for the moon’s light to slide through. I could just distinguish the corners of the slanted ceiling, the ghost-like afterimage of the lights, the rectangular shadow of the cupboard. A slight ringing overtook my ears. My eyelids closed.

I woke to a scratching sound. A rough scraping that struck through solid brick and grated against my eardrums, shaking the very foundations of the house.

I might have been frightened—I should have been—but instead I felt nothing at all, as if this was as normal as my husband returning from work.

I sat up, and watched. Waited.

The ceiling cracked. Something sharp and metal stabbed down, right through it, raining down chunks of plaster and dust. The spiderweb of cracks spread, like lines of infection. A grinding crunch. The metal redacted, punched through again. It sawed, drawing and shearing back and forth in sharp breaths. I watched it move.

Bricks tumbled down from the gaping hole, letting moonlight spill forth onto my bed in a pool. A giant shard of rock narrowly missed my knee.

I watched, calmly, expressionless as a figure poked their head through the hole in the roof. Their face a shadowed, silhouetted against the stars. They held a great saw in their right hand, blade ragged and dusted, glinting bright.

They climbed down, stood perfectly balanced on the edge of the bed. Now, I could see them. A tall man, hairy, thick arms and sporting a pair of brown overalls. I could see the crescent-shaped moon in the hole he had created.

"Hello," I said politely.

"Sorry for the bother," he’d replied. "I’ll be on my way."

I’d nodded, understandingly, and watched him leave.

When I woke the next morning, I decided it had all been a vivid dream. Except the hole was still there, gaping at me from the roof.
