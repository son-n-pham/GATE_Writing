### Write in a proper structure (2/2)

Excellent structure with a clear introduction setting the scene of the game, a body describing the frustration, and a conclusion where Jamie decides to step away.

### Choose a tone to match the theme of the writing (3/3)

The tone effectively conveys the intensity and frustration of the gaming experience, shifting to a more peaceful tone when Jamie looks outside.

### Include emotions and feelings (1/1)

Emotions are clearly expressed, such as Jamie's frustration when he loses ("He banged his fist on the desk") and his subsequent relief and anticipation of going outside ("I might go outside instead, he said, grinning.").

### Use precise words or phrases (1/1)

Precise language is used effectively, for example, "fire-engine red Cadillac" and "luxurious scarlet Cadillac" paint a vivid picture of the car.

### Use at least THREE figurative languages (3/3)

Good use of figurative language enhances the writing:

- "The rest of the world was blocked out like a thick blanket" - _Simile_ showing Jamie's immersion in the game.
- "Sirens wailed and screamed" - _Personification_ bringing the game sounds to life.
- "The big red words danced across the screen" - _Personification_ emphasizing the taunting nature of the game.

### Have a moral (Goal to focus on) (1/1)

The story effectively conveys a moral about the importance of balance and not getting too absorbed in virtual activities, suggesting the real world offers its own rewards.

### Write with an outstanding idea (3/3)

The narrative is engaging and relatable, capturing the intense focus of gaming and the subsequent realization of the world outside. The transition from frustration to anticipation of outdoor activities is well-done.

### TOTAL MARKS: 14/14 (100%)

### Strengths:

- Clear and engaging structure.
- Effective use of tone to match the narrative.
- Strong incorporation of emotions and figurative language.

### Areas for Improvement:

- While the descriptions are good, adding more sensory details (sight, sound, smell, touch) when Jamie looks outside could further enhance the contrast with the gaming world. For example, describing the smell of fresh-cut grass or the warmth of the sun.
- Exploring Jamie's internal thoughts more deeply could add another layer to the character.

### Overall Assessment:

Skylar has written a well-structured and engaging piece that effectively uses descriptive language and figurative language to convey the experience of a frustrated gamer who decides to step away from the screen. The story has a clear moral and is easy to follow. Excellent work!
