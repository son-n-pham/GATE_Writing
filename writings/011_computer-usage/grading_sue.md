### Write in a proper structure (2/2)

Excellent structure with a clear introduction immersing the reader in the game, a tense and action-filled body, and a concluding moment of defeat and disqualification.

### Choose a tone to match the theme of the writing (3/3)

The tone is consistently intense and action-packed, perfectly matching the fast-paced environment of a video game. Words like "pounding," "dodging," "scuttle," and "hiss" contribute to this feeling.

### Include emotions and feelings (1/1)

Emotions are effectively conveyed, such as the player's urgency when being followed ("I grit my teeth, urging my legs to go faster") and the frustration and disappointment at being defeated ("I stare at the screen... All that built-up XP, all for nothing.").

### Use precise words or phrases (1/1)

Precise language is used to create vivid imagery, such as "clenching my rifle in tight fists," "bin overflowing with foul-looking bags of rubbish," and "gunfire that tears chunks out of the pavement."

### Use at least THREE figurative languages (3/3)

Good use of figurative language enhances the action:

- "pounding through the streets of Opus" - _Personification_ gives the streets a sense of being actively traversed.
- "dodging the cars as they streak down the packed road" - _Simile_ compares the fast movement of cars to streaks.
- "A sudden explosion rattles the buildings" - _Personification_ makes the explosion feel more impactful.

### Have a moral (Goal to focus on) (0/1)

While the story is engaging, it doesn't clearly convey a moral or lesson. The focus is primarily on the action and the immediate experience of the game.

### Write with an outstanding idea (3/3)

The narrative is creative and immersive, placing the reader directly into the high-stakes environment of the game. The sequence of events is exciting and easy to visualize.
