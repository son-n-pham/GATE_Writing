The rest of the world was blocked out like a thick blanket that had been thrown over Jamie and his laptop. Gunfire exploded as Jamie drove his car, swerving around sharp corners and ramming into police officers. His fire-engine red Cadillac was a blur. Sirens wailed and screamed, but the finish line was right there.

WHAM!

A battered blue police car rammed against Jamie's expensive red car. CAUGHT! The big red words danced across the screen, taunting him. He quickly checked his inventory. His luxurious scarlet Cadillac was gone! He banged his fist on the desk. His bold and brash move had sealed the loss of his well-earned car!

Jamie slammed his laptop shut and tore off his headphones. He swore he would never play a video game again. He ruffled his red hair and cracked his neck from side to side.

He looked around and saw everybody else was totally absorbed in their video games. "They're all just wasting their time," he thought. He stood up and stretched. He looked outside. The sky was a pure and brilliant blue. The cool breeze ruffled the green grass blades. He couldn't wait for the grass to grow.

"I might go outside instead," he said, grinning.
