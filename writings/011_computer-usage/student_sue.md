I'm pounding through the streets of Opus, dodging the cars as they streak down the packed road. Clenching my rifle in tight fists, I scuttle along the edge of the foot of the skyscraper, around a tree and into a dimly lit alleyway.

My headpiece buzzes and Leander's voice crackles in my ear.

"Lead to team B, meet at the 23rd square. Lie low, don't shoot unless you have to."

"Copy," I whisper back as I break into a fast run, scaling up a wall to leap over a bin overflowing with foul-looking bags of rubbish.

I move, spurring my legs into motion, kicking up pebbles in my wake.

A flicker of something catches the edge of my vision and I swing my gaze around for just a moment—a blur of someone blue tailing me a street away.

Shoot.

"I'm being followed," I hiss into the speaker.  
"Nightjar speaking, I'm being followed."

Someone swears on the other end. I grit my teeth, urging my legs to go faster, angling my gun in the direction of my pursuer.

"What colour?" Leander demands.

"Blue," I say.

I hear him swear again.

"Keep running."

I do. I can see the edges of trees that trace 22nd square, but I am beginning to tire, steps slowing.

A sudden explosion rattles the buildings and a blinding burst of light. I'm thrown to the ground in a rush. Someone shouts into the headset, but I can't hear them against the onslaught of gunfire that tears chunks out of the pavement.

I duck and roll, firing shots over my shoulder that go wide. A black car swerves—dangerously close to hitting me.

Something catches me full in the chest—my avatar staggers and keels over.  
Dead.

I stare at the screen, at the rising smoke and crumpled form. All that built-up XP, all for nothing.

Leander shouts, hurling insults at Team A, his voice ringing on my headphones. He stabs his middle finger in the air and screams a string of profanities.

I slam my fists on the keyboard as a gaming organiser taps me on the shoulder with an apologetic smile.

"Team B has been disqualified."
