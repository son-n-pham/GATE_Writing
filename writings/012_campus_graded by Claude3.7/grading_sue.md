### Detailed Rubric Assessment

1. Story Structure and Plot Flow (1/2 marks)
   - Evidence: The essay moves from descriptions of people to the revelation that the narrator is a cat.
   - Analysis: The essay has a unique observational structure but lacks a traditional narrative arc with clear beginning, middle, and end.
   - Score Justification: While the piece flows well as a series of observations, it lacks a clear progression of events.
   - Improvement Strategy: Consider adding a small event or incident to create more structure.
   - Example of improvement: "I watched as a student dropped their papers, creating a momentary chaos in the ordered flow of the crowd. No one stopped to help until..."

2. Topic Relevance (5/5 marks)
   - Evidence: "The sky is a blazing cerulean blue... There are so many different colours and scents and shapes and bodies."
   - Analysis: The essay directly addresses the urban environment prompt, capturing the bustling city scene from a unique perspective.
   - Score Justification: Every element of the story connects perfectly to the busy urban setting depicted in the prompt.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue developing strong connections to prompts while maintaining your unique perspective.
   - Example of improvement: Add more specific urban elements like "The shadows of tall buildings created cool islands in the sea of sunlight."

3. Atmosphere and Theme (2/2 marks)
   - Evidence: "The sky is a blazing cerulean blue, the sun a blinding circle of white casting harsh lights against the sides of the brick buildings."
   - Analysis: Creates a vivid atmosphere through contrasting elements and detailed descriptions of the environment.
   - Score Justification: The setting details effectively establish the mood and reinforce the theme of observation and potential connection.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue developing atmosphere through sensory contrasts.
   - Example of improvement: "The cool pavement beneath my paws contrasted with the warm sunlight on my fur, much like the hurried humans below contrasted with my leisurely observations."

4. Sensory Details (2/2 marks)
   - Evidence: "Blazing cerulean blue," "scents and shapes," "heat of the sun," "Feet move, shoes pounding on grass and pavement, raining down in pattering, uneven rhythms."
   - Analysis: Incorporates rich visual, tactile, auditory, and spatial sensory details.
   - Score Justification: Multiple sensory elements are woven naturally throughout the narrative.
   - Improvement Strategy: Consider incorporating taste elements to complete the sensory experience.
   - Example of improvement: "I lick my paw, tasting the dust of the city that clings to my fur."

5. Character Development (1/2 marks)
   - Evidence: The narrator (a cat) contemplates connection at the end: "Perhaps a sense of togetherness wouldn't be so bad."
   - Analysis: There is a hint of character development in the narrator's final reflection but limited growth throughout.
   - Score Justification: The character shows interesting traits but minimal development within the piece.
   - Improvement Strategy: Show more progression in the narrator's feelings about humans.
   - Example of improvement: Early in the piece, add: "I used to disdain their frantic movements, but lately I've found myself curious." Then build toward the final realization.

6. Sizzling Start (1/1 mark)
   - Evidence: "The sky is a blazing cerulean blue, the sun a blinding circle of white casting harsh lights against the sides of the brick buildings."
   - Analysis: Immediately establishes setting with vivid, sensory-rich language.
   - Score Justification: The opening creates immediate visual engagement and atmospheric context.
   - Improvement Strategy: Consider adding an element of intrigue or mystery to the opening.
   - Example of improvement: "The sky is a blazing cerulean blue, the sun a blinding circle of white casting harsh lights against the sides of the brick buildings, revealing secrets only I can see from my perch."

7. Conflict Development (0/2 marks)
   - Evidence: The piece is primarily observational without a central conflict.
   - Analysis: The narrative lacks a clear problem or tension to be resolved.
   - Score Justification: While beautifully descriptive, the essay doesn't present a conflict with complications and resolution.
   - Improvement Strategy: Introduce a small problem or desire for the narrator cat.
   - Example of improvement: "I search for the human who brings me treats every Tuesday, scanning each face in the crowd. The familiar red backpack is nowhere to be seen. Did they forget our ritual?"

8. Figurative Language (3/3 marks)
   - Evidence: "They hover and move in flocks like birds" (simile), "The organized chaos shifts and moves like its own thinking organism" (simile/personification), "a cyclist skitters over the ground as if in flight, swift as a bird" (simile)
   - Analysis: Effective use of multiple types of figurative language that enhance the narrative.
   - Score Justification: The piece uses three or more types of figurative language effectively.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue to vary figurative language and perhaps experiment with metaphor and hyperbole.
   - Example of improvement: "The campus was an anthill, the humans scurrying along their predetermined paths with the urgency of creatures preparing for winter."

9. Moral/Theme Message (1/2 marks)
   - Evidence: "Perhaps a sense of togetherness wouldn't be so bad."
   - Analysis: There's a subtle message about connection and community at the end.
   - Score Justification: While present, the moral feels somewhat underdeveloped and introduced only at the end.
   - Improvement Strategy: Thread the theme of connection vs. isolation throughout the piece.
   - Example of improvement: Early in the piece, add: "I observe their connections from a distance, both curious and cautious." Then build toward the final reflection.

10. Ending (1/2 marks)
    - Evidence: "Perhaps a sense of togetherness wouldn't be so bad."
    - Analysis: The ending introduces a new thought that suggests character growth but feels somewhat abrupt.
    - Score Justification: The conclusion offers a thoughtful reflection but doesn't fully tie up the observations that came before.
    - Improvement Strategy: Develop a more complete conclusion that connects to earlier observations.
    - Example of improvement: "I lick my paw one last time and stretch, my decision made. Today, instead of just watching the organized chaos from above, I will descend and weave myself into the tapestry of their lives. Perhaps a sense of togetherness wouldn't be so bad."

11. Original Idea (1/1 mark)
    - Evidence: The entire piece is narrated from a cat's perspective observing humans in an urban setting.
    - Analysis: The choice to depict a busy urban environment from a non-human perspective offers a fresh and unexpected viewpoint.
    - Score Justification: The approach to the prompt is highly original and thought-provoking.
    - Improvement Strategy: Continue developing unique perspectives on common scenes.
    - Example of improvement: Consider how the cat's observations might reveal something about human nature that humans themselves miss.

12. Technical Accuracy (1/1 mark)
    - Evidence: The essay demonstrates proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation throughout.
    - Analysis: Technical elements are well-executed with proper paragraph structure.

- Strategic Development Plan: Sue shows remarkable skill with language and creative perspective-taking. To further develop as a writer, focus on incorporating traditional narrative elements like conflict and resolution while maintaining your unique observational style. Consider how a seemingly simple event might create tension or change for your narrator. Your strong descriptive abilities could be enhanced by exploring how sensory details might change in response to the narrator's emotional state. Continue to experiment with unexpected narrators and perspectives in future writing.
