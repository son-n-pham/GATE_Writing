The sky is a blazing cerulean blue, the sun a blinding circle of white casting harsh lights against the sides of the brick buildings.

I can see them everywhere walking and chatting as they moved from point A to B to any particular location they needed to get to.

There are so many different colours and scents and shapes and bodies.

I have observed humans for a while, their strange interactions and stories.

They hover and move in flocks like birds sometimes, loud and social, a group sprawled on the quad to study with books open on their laps, others chatting in twos and threes or hurrying to their next destination with a bag slung over their shoulder.

Feet move, shoes pounding on grass and pavement, raining down in pattering, uneven rhythms.

Someone bends down to pet me, I arch my back obligingly, rubbing my fur against their leg.

I watch as the organized chaos shifts and moves like its own thinking organism.

The heat of the sun is warm on my back. I observe as a cyclist skitters over the ground as if in flight, swift as a bird. Cars ease slowly through the forest of limbs. There's something a little uncanny about these humans, something I can't quite put my paw to. Their sense of superiority? I don't think that is it. I lick my paw and stretch, gazing down at them as they mingle. Perhaps a sense of togetherness wouldn't be so bad.
