Everything seemed so big. Towering white buildings. A tall bronze statue of the president. An ethereal light bathed Elisa's golden brown skin. She felt like a child among the mature and prim older students.

The whole campus was alive, a bustling city. Elisa was lost and elbowed around. She looked down at the crumpled time table in her sweaty hand. She was already late for her first class.

"Excuse me, where is block C?" she asked timidly to an older student.

He looked down at the small, scared frizzy haired girl.
"Somewhere," he said rudely.

Elisa looked around. The smug grin upon the President's face seemed to mock her.

Someone tapped lightly on her shoulder.
"Need help?" A girl Elisa's age asked.

She was a first year herself but she had the air of a girl who had memorized the complex tapestry of the school map. The girl pushed her thick glasses up her freckly nose and held up a hand to shake.

Elisa decided she liked the girl's intelligent green eyes and dark chocolate brown hair, so she shook her hand, even though the whole hand shaking seemed a little too formal.

Until then, Elisa never thought she would find someone like her. But at her new school she had discovered the first of her people. Her small pride of lions.
