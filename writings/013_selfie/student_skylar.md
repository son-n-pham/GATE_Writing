When your mum drags you by your collar and drags you in front of her phone, a bright red flush creeps up your cheeks. You grit your teeth and plaster a fake grin on your face. "You're blocking the painting!" you mutter between clenched teeth.

Do you have a parent who is wholeheartedly interested in creating embarrassing memories through the horror movie of embarrassing selfies?

Do you have a mum who's clogging up your storage with hundreds of selfies? If so, I have the perfect solution to your worries, a list of important reasons to not take too many public selfies.

Dear selfie addicted adult,

I fully understand the importance of memories. They can get lost as easily as leaves in the wind. However, millions of public selfies are not the solution. Do you remember when you yelled at your child for saving internet memes? You can't say anything because you've been clogging up photo storage with billions of public selfies. Don't you see the embarrassment on your child's face? Sense their discomfort? At least only take one selfie.

So, please do not clog up your storage and waste your time by the dreaded torture of public selfies. Please reconsider.

Yours Truly,
The Anti Selfie Activist
