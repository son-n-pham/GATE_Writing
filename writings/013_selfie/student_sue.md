The room is large, rectangular. It could easily have been the size of an Olympic swimming pool, perhaps larger.

You would have thought that something was going on in there, a meeting, a congregation of sorts. All I see are a jumble of hundreds of bodies, elbows knocking together, the rising chatter of voices so many, so indistinct they blur together into a cacophony of white noise.

All this effort, all this fuss for a single artifact.

I wouldn’t have found the painting particularly remarkable, myself. It was old, a little grey and green, a little faded. The paint had cracked in places, or gone from pale pink to a sallow yellow. It was a woman, hands clasped, smiling benignly at the viewer.

Perhaps the smile was the reason so many historians, artists were so transfixed. The gentle curve of lips, eyes pleasant but the more one looked at it, the more she peered into your soul. People had called her alluring, smile mysterious.

I had always thought they were being a little overenthusiastic. The smile could be just a smile.
The artist could have come across an unlucky coincidence. And yet, people observed the very cracks in the canvas as if they held great mysteries, spelling out letters invisible to the eye, claiming that such a painting contained a secret message.

Even the painting’s frame seemed more appealing to me, golden and carefully gilded with such small, intricate patterns. Or maybe I was just the irrational one here.

Over time, the painting has become a symbol.
Hundreds of people see it every day—or do they really? I watch them jostle for position at the front, pushing at the ropes, pulling them back. Several times, I have to usher the more forward tourists back into line. Wouldn’t want the painting to be damaged.

Cameras flicker even as flash lighting is banned.
Most of the people have stopped bothering to catch a glimpse of the painting altogether; it has become a convenient place to snap selfies to brag to their friends. “Oh, guess what! I saw the Mona Lisa! Yes, it was rather boring. So crowded! Check out this photo!”

They say some art is priceless. But now, looking back at the museum turned into a public selfie booth, I wonder if this value Here is the extracted text from the image has been diminished somewhat.

What was once grand is now a joke.
There are so many better, lesser-known pieces of art that deserve attention, is there not?
Or does the attention take away the value?

Fame is a double-edged sword.
