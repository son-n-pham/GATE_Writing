"Our new neighbourhood." Pete leaned against the wooden fence as warm sunlight bathed his soft skin. The wind danced playfully through his golden hair and the lush grass tickled his feet. The sky was a canvas of tender pink famed orange strokes. Tall green trees swayed gently on the spot gently batting away the teasing wind. A small cluster of white houses nestle in a nook where hills rose behind them.

"Look!" Trista cried. "It's a badger!"
The little family looked at where Trista's pale finger was pointed.
"It's a snake!" Kale said, dusting his brown overalls.
Pete and Leah chuckled.
Pete loved his family.
