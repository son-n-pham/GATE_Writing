The clock on the wall ticked, a steady rhythm in the otherwise still room. It was 10:10, or perhaps it had always been 10:10. The light wood table held a vase overflowing with vibrant flowers, their petals a riot of pinks, yellows, and reds. A few oranges sat beside them, their skins glowing like embers. I ran my hand over the plush velvet of the pink sofa, the purple pillows soft beneath my touch. A beige blanket lay carelessly draped across the back. The room was a haven of comfort, a familiar space.

But then, my gaze drifted to the doorway. It wasn't a single door, but a series of white panels, each leading to another, stretching into the distance. And the floor, the light green floor of the room, rippled and shifted as it met the doorway, transforming into a sea of blue and white. The sky beyond was a soft pink, bleeding into a deeper red at the horizon where it met the water. It was a surreal transition, a merging of the familiar and the impossible.

I stepped through the first door, the cool water lapping at my feet. The scent of salt and roses filled the air. Each door was a step further into the unknown, a journey into a world where the laws of physics seemed to bend and break. I wondered where these doors led, what lay beyond the horizon. Was it a dream, a memory, or something else entirely? The possibilities were endless, as vast and mysterious as the sea that stretched before me.
