The front door slammed behind me. I looked around at Isabelle's house. The floor was as blue as the sea. The walls were painted a rosy pink and a bunch of sweet smelling colourful flowers sat next to four ripe oranges on a wooden coffee table. Wind danced in through the open window, blowing back the alabaster curtains and tickling the lush green leaves of large house plant. A pink sofa on golden legs leaned against the wall, two purple pillows and a yellow blanket resting upon its plush velvet surface.

The petals on the flower swirled and danced through the air and there wide open was a white door with a glistening gold handle. I stood there spellbound until I shook my head and pushed the hazy fog out of my brain. My fists clenched.

"I am here to scold Isabelle not admire her house," I said stepping through the white door. I cupped my long pale hands around my mouth and shouted: "Hey Isabelle, excuse me?"

And then I took in the real beauty of her house. The walls, the floor, the ceiling were all painted like the sun setting peacefully over the azure ocean. My daughter must be wonderful to paint all of this. I shook my head and pushed that to the back of my mind.

"Isabelle, come out this instant!" I growled.

But I notice another thing. Rows of open identical white doors, all open, leading down a beautifully painted hallway. Just then, Isabelle ran scurried down the hall, her flaxen hair flying, a fretful look on her face. "Sorry!" she cried, "Didn't meanâ€”" I silenced her with a finger, gazed down the hallway and filled with wonder.
