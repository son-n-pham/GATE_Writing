The boy leans back on the lounge chair, crossing his ankles over the armrest as he sprawled against the seat like a cat basking in the sun, hands pillowed behind his head.

"I dunno." His eyes trace the outline of the clock hanging suspended above the flower vase, pulse beating to the steady tick... tick...

"It's kind of like those... Russian nesting dolls, you know? The doorways." He turns an orange peach around in his fingers, considering.

"There's always one inside the other," I supply, watching as he plucks the leaf off the peach and lets it flutter in the non-existent breeze.

"Sounds 'bout right." He cracks his mouth open into a yawn, pink gums and white teeth, stretching languorously.

"Easy for you to say," the wind ruffles the decorative monstera leaves, blows the gauzy curtains to a ruffle and tears the petals from roses blooming in the vase. "You're not the one who has to travel interdimensionally.‚Äù

The carpet shifts hues under my feet, rippling blue and white and turquoise like the sea.

"Do what you want," Peach juice leaks from the corner of his mouth, the skin of its sweet flesh stuck in his teeth. "You could just stay in this in-between place for all I care."

I open the door, feeling the hard plastic of the handle turning. It is a room, just like this one and an identical white panelled door that leads to another, and another and another. I count four, the last opening to red sky and bringing with it the scent of roses and peaches and sea salt. The exit.

I take a step forward, the breeze cool on my skin.

"Thank you," I tell the boy, but when I turn he is gone; all that is left is the lounge chair, three purple canvas cushions piled in the corners and a rumple blanket. My words are met with air.

The clock ticks.

"Endless, huh?" I turn to the doorways, the sky that spreads red and purple like watercolour, heedless of boundaries.

"I guess I'll just see what the universe has in store for me!" Easier said than done.
