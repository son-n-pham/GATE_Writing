The man's hair was a black bird's nest on his round, egg-like head. He had on a neatly buttoned checkered blue work shirt with a small black tie. His forehead was creased with worry as he stared down at his phone.

I looked at him carefully from my side of the train compartment. I analyzed his slouch and his horrible forward neck posture. He was muttering incoherently—sad, worried, and frustrated. I leaned closer to look at his phone. It was open on a gambling app.

"Sir," I said before I could stop myself. "Did you ever realize that gambling is not good? You are bound to lose money, and from your posture, worried face, and phone, I deduce that you have lost some money—or perhaps worse."

I bit my tongue to stop the flood of words spilling out of my mouth. The man glared at me.

"Nosy know-it-all," he muttered and edged away from me.

I thought of Paisley, a little girl I'd scared to the point she cried with my words.

"Sorry sir, but I can't keep holding back my words. They itch if I don't." I clapped my hands over my mouth. The man wrinkled his nose and turned away. At that moment, his messy black hair slipped over the tiniest bit.

"Sir, are you wearing a wig?" I asked before I could quickly bite my knuckles.

"One day," said the man, seething with frustration, "you will learn that big mouths come with a cost."

I nodded and, for the first time, I stopped speaking and stared out of the window into the boring barren lands outside of the train. All I could do was hope that the man's scalp wouldn't itch and he would stop his gambling.
