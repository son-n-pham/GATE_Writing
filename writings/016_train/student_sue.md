Mr Hilkins is in for a rather long day.

He supposes it might have been his fault - for the first time that year, he was about to be late for work.

He reaches the station at half-past seven, feeling the seat of his pants strain a little against his stomach. Perhaps it wouldn't have been right after all about him eating too much pudding the night before, although he would rather eat his own tie than admit that to her.

He can still taste the lingering sweetness perched at the back of his tongue, which brings him to wonder if he'd brushed his teeth properly. Blast it, the last thing he needed was a hefty dentist's bill.

"You really ought to take better care of your teeth!" He imagines his wife scolding.

Mr Hilkins very nearly misses his train.

Inside, the compartments are crowded, each seat filled. The air smells faintly of new shoes, engines and airports.

He sits down, claiming the last available seat. He doesn't notice that his seat has a rather nasty-looking food stain on it, and his fellow passengers inwardly decide that it would be kinder not to let him know.

The train starts, racing across the tracks as buildings and poles whip by. Mr Hilkins watches them for a moment. The woman he is sitting next to does as well; neither of them are up to much small-talking.

His phone rings out, a tune jangling that elicits a few curious head turns in his direction. Hilkins pulls it out and sees the notification.

The woman beside him tilts her head slightly, vaguely intrigued. Hilkins doesn't see her, or the lady in front giving him a side-eye.

He reads the message. It's from his wife.

"Honey, you left your suitcase at home!"

Wait. What?

He sits bolt upright and his eyes fly back to the window. His seat mate hurriedly averts her eyes, pretending she hadn't been watching after all.

He is approximately 4 miles west from his house and suitcase.
