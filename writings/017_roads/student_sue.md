The bottles were smashed. I’d grabbed everything I could: money, tins of canned tuna, pens, packets of cereal, a kitchen knife. Into the pockets they went, bulging against the fabric. It was pathetic, I realise now. I wasn’t going to survive at this rate.

I’d taken a card for my expenses, but I wasn’t sure how long it’d last. I took a train and stayed on it, stubbornly, for hours on end. I didn’t know where I would end up. When I stepped off, my worn sneakers were met with bristled green grass and a sky devoid of any colour. The sun was invisible, blanketed in clouds.

It all stretched, the rolling expanse of dry grass, a few naked trees scattered sparsely, dark branches clawing at the sky.

My legs felt leaden. I lifted my head, feeling the crisp bite of cold country air and the smell of dead leaves.

A path had been flattened through the plants by car tires, two strips of dirt road running parallel. I followed it.

My mind felt clearer, somehow, a stark contrast against my aching limbs, feet dragging as they scuffed the dirt.

Perhaps it was the fresh dose of clean air, the emptiness of people and absence of their chatter. I’d run away, that much I knew. I’d done it before, but this time I’d gotten so far. Reached the outskirts.

I couldn’t let myself be pushed around anymore.

In front of me, the ground was rising, a slight hill. The tire paths diverged, left and right. I stopped walking.

I knew this place, had been here before, once. Many years ago. Grass crunched underfoot.

If only, if only...

Left went on indefinitely. I could see it, curving off somewhere I didn’t know.

To the right were the faintest outlines of buildings, farmhouses outlined on the pale horizon.

My feet moved, taking me.

I’m coming home.
