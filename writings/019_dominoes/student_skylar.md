"Do you know how to play dominoes?" I ask gently.
Pa looks at me blankly, a distant longing look in his empty hazel eyes. He slumps in his wheel chair. After a while, he speaks.
"I don't know," He says hoarsely.

I place a mug of warm milk in his hand and smile, pulling out a small tin box with a domino engraved on its front. I silently open it and place a few dominoes on the table.

Pa shakily examines a little wooden domino. I hold my breath as he gazes at it.
"Angele," He whispers wistfully.
It's as if he has seen the ghost of Ma. His eyes twinkled for just a moment.
"See," I say. "You can make patterns."

I pull out the dominoes and tip them on the table. It looks like a bundle of colorful flowers the way they are so beautifully painted.

I make a little line with some. Pa slowly reaches out a dark hand and seems to absentmindedly make a drawing out of the dominoes. Soft brown skin. Hazel eyes glowing and morphing like a kaleidoscope. Black messy hair. It all seems to fit together like a puzzle. It's Ma.

A tear slips down Pa's cheek.
"I see Angele everywhere," He says softly, gazing into my eyes. "I have to see her again."

That's the most Pa has ever talked since Ma left.
