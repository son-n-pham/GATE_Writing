Dear Uncle Ray,

Thank you so much for letting me visit today! I had a brilliant time playing word scatters with you! I really love the tapes you sent for me. While I can't say rock is my favourite, there is a certain appeal to listening to Guns 'n Roses!

I have exams coming up in a couple of months. You've been such good help, especially with Physics. There aren't a lot of girls in my course but your knowledge is really helpful!

- Bree :)

"You're missing several letters."

Bree stares down at the array of words strewn in front of her like a crossword puzzle.

TAKE, BEACH, KENDO, OCEAN, NIGHT, TO.

Her lips tug up on their own accord, a familiar competitive spark igniting in her mind's eye.

"I win," she reaches for the die.

"Not so fast," Uncle Ray moves a piece from his pile, several pieces that form a string of words. The triumph drains from Bree's face.

"Oh, come on! You never let me win!" The chocolates are slid over. Uncle Ray takes a piece, teeth glinting white against his dark moustache as he chews on it.

"I never go easy on you."

Dear Uncle Ray,
I started my first day of college today! I really can't believe I've gotten this far, I couldn't have done this without you!

London is so different! It's rained non-stop since I got here at the airport two days ago. I guess Lucy was right about the bad weather!

And gosh, all these British accents! I feel like I'm the only American in miles. My roommate's not here yet. I'll write more as soon as I can!

- Bree xx
