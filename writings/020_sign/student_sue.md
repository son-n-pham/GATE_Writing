The air is cold and crisp, a steady wind that bites and stings my exposed skin. The tip of my nose is ice-cold and my breaths snuffle, exhaling wisps of fog like smoke from a cigarette.

The horizon is a ragged line of hills and mountains, dark and blue against the gradually paling sky, blushing a hazy pink as the sun begins to rise.

I've been running, for how long I don't know. It was dark before and now there's a light - had I really been running for the whole night?

I've been going on so long that I can no longer see the plumes of smoke behind me or taste the lingering scent of ash. The coldness of the atmosphere is sharp on my senses, a splash of icy reality.

The adrenaline is slowly ebbing away, draining from a leak in the tap, leaving a dull ache in my bones.

I know what I must do. Now that the stars are disappearing, I have to follow the road, I have to follow the sun as it rises, I have to head east. I will run, pausing only to drink water and if I play my cards right, I can make it to the next town. I will be safe there.

There is nothing left for me now. It's just me, the long, bare stretch of untamed grass, the dirt road, the distant mountains and slow awakening of the sun. The ground crunches under my shoes, pounding unwaveringly. My limbs are screaming for rest, but I am afraid that if I stop I will never be able to start again.

My home is gone, the buildings are rubble and I must push on, no matter what.

I am past desperation now, I am past the point of no return.

Life is a journey, and I will not let my destination be the death of me.
