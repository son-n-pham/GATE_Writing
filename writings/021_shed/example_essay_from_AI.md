The shed door creaked open, releasing a sigh of old wood and forgotten things. Dust motes danced in the twilight as Elara stepped out, the cool evening air a stark contrast to the stuffy confines she’d just left. Above, the sky was a painter’s masterpiece, deep indigo bleeding into softer blues as the sun dipped below the horizon. A slender crescent moon hung like a silver fingernail in the vast expanse. In the distance, the impossible shimmered – a city of slender spires and graceful arches, seemingly adrift amongst the wispy clouds. It was a sight she’d only ever glimpsed in dreams, yet here it was, a breathtaking anomaly against the familiar backdrop of her backyard.

Barnaby, her scruffy brown terrier, trotted over, his tail giving a tentative wag. He nudged a gleaming gold chalice lying half-hidden in the grass, then sniffed at the ornate sword stuck upright in the lawn like some misplaced monument. Around them lay a scattering of gold coins, catching the last rays of the sun, and a delicate silver necklace, its gems winking like captured starlight. It was a treasure trove spilled onto ordinary suburban grass.

Elara ran a hand through her hair, still catching the scent of sawdust and damp earth from the shed. The shed wasn't just a shed anymore. It was a gateway. She’d stumbled upon the truth while searching for old gardening tools – a faint shimmer in the back corner, a whisper of magic clinging to the air. Pushing aside a dusty tarpaulin, she’d found not the back wall, but a swirling vortex of light, a portal humming with unseen energy.

Hesitantly, she’d stepped through, finding herself not in another part of the shed, but in a corridor of polished obsidian, the air thick with the scent of ozone and something ancient. She hadn't gone far, a sense of caution holding her back, but she’d seen enough. Glimpses of that floating city, heard the faint music carried on the otherworldly breeze. And she’d brought back… souvenirs. Tokens of a reality she wasn't sure she was ready for.

Barnaby whined softly, pawing at the base of the sword. He didn’t understand, of course. He just saw shiny things. But Elara understood. The ordinary and the extraordinary had collided in her backyard. The question was, what was she going to do about it? The floating city beckoned, a silent promise of adventure and untold wonders. But the fence, the doghouse, the familiar comfort of her home – they held her too. For now.
