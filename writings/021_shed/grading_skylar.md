- Evidence: The dialogue flows logically, setting up a clear scenario and conflict, leading to the unexpected barrier.

- Improvement Strategy: Continue focusing on clear transitions between dialogue and action to maintain a strong narrative flow.

#### Tone (3/3 marks)

- Evidence: Phrases like "Whatever! I don't care what the stupid map says!" and "You're so annoying," establish a bickering and slightly humorous tone.

- Improvement Strategy: Maintain this consistent tone throughout your writing to create a strong voice.
