### Detailed Rubric Assessment

#### Structure (1.5/2 marks)

- Evidence: The essay presents a sequence of events, starting with the spoiled milk and ending with Mr. Chiron opening the shed door.
- Analysis: The narrative has a discernible beginning, middle, and end, creating a basic structural framework.
- Score Justification: While the essay follows a chronological order, some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the flow. For instance, the shift from Mr. Chiron's reaction to the milk to his routine with the dog could be more connected.
- Improvement Strategy: Focus on creating stronger transitional sentences or phrases between paragraphs to guide the reader through the narrative more seamlessly.

#### Tone (2.5/3 marks)

- Evidence: Phrases like "burning like acid on my tongue" and the description of the "faint silhouette of his reflection moving in the dead television screen" establish a slightly eerie and mysterious tone.
- Analysis: The tone effectively sets a subtle, unsettling atmosphere, hinting at something unusual occurring.
- Score Justification: The tone is generally consistent and appropriate for the narrative being developed. However, there are moments where the tone could be amplified to further enhance the sense of mystery or foreboding.
- Improvement Strategy: Experiment with intensifying descriptive language and sensory details to create a more palpable atmosphere throughout the essay.

#### Emotions/Feelings (0.5/1 mark)

- Evidence: The essay mentions Mr. Chiron's past desire to be an explorer and his current mundane life, suggesting a hint of lost dreams.
- Analysis: There's an underlying sense of routine and perhaps a subtle longing, but these emotions are not deeply explored.
- Score Justification: The emotions are present but remain understated. The reader could connect more with Mr. Chiron if his feelings were more explicitly conveyed.
- Improvement Strategy: Delve deeper into Mr. Chiron's internal state by explicitly describing his feelings or using internal monologue to reveal his thoughts and emotions.

#### Precise Language (0.75/1 mark)

- Evidence: Descriptions like "stinking of foot cheese" and "armchair was hard as rock" use precise language to create vivid sensory experiences.
- Analysis: The language is generally accurate and contributes to the imagery in the essay.
- Score Justification: While there are instances of precise language, there are also opportunities to use more evocative and specific word choices to further enrich the descriptions.
- Improvement Strategy: Focus on selecting words that not only describe but also evoke stronger sensory experiences for the reader.

#### Figurative Language (2/3 marks)

- Evidence: Examples include "burning like acid on my tongue," "hard as rock under his weight," and "shadow silently slips away, a moving shroud."
- Analysis: The essay incorporates similes and metaphors to enhance the descriptions and add depth to the narrative.
- Score Justification: The use of figurative language is present and effective in certain instances. Adding more varied and original figures of speech could further elevate the writing.
- Improvement Strategy: Actively seek opportunities to incorporate a wider range of figurative language, such as metaphors, similes, and personification, to make the writing more engaging and imaginative.

#### Moral/Goal (0/1 mark)

- Evidence: The essay primarily describes a series of events and doesn't explicitly convey a moral or a clear goal.
- Analysis: The focus is more on setting a scene and creating an atmosphere rather than delivering a message or pursuing a specific objective.
- Score Justification: The absence of a clear moral or goal makes it difficult to identify a central message or purpose in the narrative.
- Improvement Strategy: Consider what message or insight you want the reader to take away from the story and weave that into the narrative.

#### Creative Merit (2/3 marks)

- Evidence: The concept of the shadow detaching from Mr. Chiron and the subtle hints of a "castle in the sky" introduce fantastical elements into an otherwise mundane setting.
- Analysis: The essay shows a good level of creativity by blending reality with subtle hints of the extraordinary.
- Score Justification: The core idea is creative and intriguing. Expanding on the fantastical elements and their connection to the main narrative could further enhance the creative merit.
- Improvement Strategy: Develop the imaginative aspects of the story more fully. Explore the implications of the shadow's departure and the significance of the "castle in the sky."

### TOTAL MARKS: 7.5/14 (53.57%)

### Strengths:

- Effective use of descriptive language to create sensory experiences.
- Intriguing and mysterious tone that captures the reader's attention.
- Creative concept of the shadow slipping away.

### Areas for Improvement:

- Develop a clearer moral or goal for the narrative to provide a stronger sense of purpose.

- Strengthen transitions between paragraphs for a smoother reading experience.

### Overall Assessment:

Sue's essay shows promise in its descriptive language and creation of an intriguing atmosphere. The concept of the disappearing shadow is a strong point of creativity. However, the essay would benefit from a clearer sense of purpose or moral, and a deeper exploration of the character's emotions. Strengthening the structural flow and adding more varied figurative language would also elevate the writing.
