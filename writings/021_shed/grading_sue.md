### Detailed Rubric Assessment

#### Structure (1.5/2 marks)

- Evidence: The essay starts with the spoiled milk, introduces Mr. Chiron and his routine, and then shifts to the mysterious event of his shadow slipping away.
- Analysis: The structure is present, but the initial focus on the milk could be more clearly connected to the subsequent events to create a stronger sense of unity.
- Score Justification: The essay has a beginning, middle, and end, but the connection between the opening and the climax could be smoother.
- Improvement Strategy: Consider how the initial details you provide set the stage for the rest of your story. Ensure a clear link between different parts of your narrative.

#### Tone (2.5/3 marks)

- Evidence: The tone shifts from the unpleasantness of the sour milk to a more ominous feeling as the essay progresses, particularly with the description of the flickering lamplight and the dog's howling.
- Analysis: The shift in tone effectively builds suspense.
- Score Justification: The tone is generally appropriate, creating a sense of unease and mystery.
- Improvement Strategy: Pay attention to how tone can be used to create specific effects in your writing.

#### Emotions/Feelings (0.5/1 marks)

- Evidence: Mr. Chiron's disillusionment with his past dreams is mentioned, and the dog's unease is hinted at through its growls and howls.
- Analysis: The essay touches on these emotions, but they could be explored in more depth to create a stronger emotional connection with the reader.
