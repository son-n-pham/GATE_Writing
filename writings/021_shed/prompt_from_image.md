# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "I see an illustration of a backyard at dusk, with a person emerging from a shed. The sky is a deep blue, transitioning to lighter hues towards the horizon. There are wispy clouds and a crescent moon. In the distance, a fantastical city with spires and arches is depicted, seemingly floating in the clouds. In the foreground, there's a wooden fence enclosing the yard, and a green lawn with a few scattered objects like a gold chalice, a sword stuck in the ground, gold coins, and a necklace. A brown dog is walking towards the right of the image, near a doghouse and a dog bowl. A person in jeans and a light top is exiting the opened door of a shed. The shed is made of weathered wood and has a simple design. There are two tall green evergreen trees next to the left fence.",

They can choose the genre, but the setting and objects provide a lot of fantasy, mistery and adventure suggestions. It could be a quest, a discovery, a secret entrance, an escape, or a portal to another realm. Students need to build a narrative around the person coming out of the shed and why those objects are on the floor in a normal backyard with a doghouse.",
