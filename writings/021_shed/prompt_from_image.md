# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "The image depicts a backyard scene at dusk or early evening. The sky is a gradient of blues, with lighter hues near the horizon and darker shades towards the top, along with stylized clouds that look almost like brush strokes. A crescent moon is visible in the sky. In the background, there's a fantastical, almost ethereal cityscape with spires and domes, giving a dreamlike quality to the scene. A long bridge connects the city to the foreground. In the midground, there is a wooden fence surrounding the yard. Two tall, dark green, conifer trees stand out against the lighter sky. In the foreground, a small wooden shed with an open door is prominent. A person is entering or exiting the shed. A dog is walking towards the right. Near the center of the foreground is a sword sticking upright in the ground, and a golden cup has fallen over. Some gold coins and a green necklace are also visible scattered around. There's also a dog bowl and a dog house on the right side.",
