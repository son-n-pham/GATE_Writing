"The map says..."
"Whatever! I don't care what the stupid map says! Let's go back."

Silas grabs me by my shoulders and steers me around like car.

"I don't even know what 'Point of No Return' is," I say, indicating to the digital sign at the side of the road. Silas shakes his head and begins to turn around but I grab his wrist.

"The map says there is a checkpoint in there!"

Silas wrinkles his nose.
"Point of no return sounds like whoever goes past that sign will never return."

We stand there arguing like squabbling pigeons on the dirt path, the sky a darkening canvas above us.

My face is red.
"Honestly!" I huff and shove Silas past the sign.
He lands on his back, sand in his muddy brown hair and fire in his eyes.
"You're so annoying," He snorts as he dusts off his denim jacket.

I begin to laugh but Silas looks so infuriated that I cough my giggles down. He begins to storm towards me, probably to hurt my arm, but stops like he's bumped against an invisible barrier wall. He tries to slap me but his hand bends weirdly. He presses his whole body against the invisible barrier. His eyes squeeze like it's against glass.
"I'm stuck!" He yells. "You should've read that sign!"
