"Don't go in there!" I tell Smores sternly, arms crossed like a disapproving mother.

Smores paws against the wooden shed door and barks fiercely. I scratch his brown ears and smile.

"Because I'm going in there first," I grin, sprint across the garden in my fluffy brown slippers.

I brandish the key like it's a magical sword and jam it into the lock. I think of what could be inside. A magic portal leading to a majestic marble palace shrouded in tall pine trees? A sword of medieval times encrusted with rubies? A golden goblet made by a magical dwarf from the forges of Earth's core? A mysterious shadow man come to whisk me away to a school for wizards? A locket containing emeralds, worn by Queen Victoria herself?

The ideas buzz through me like bees, turn like cogs, soar like planes and circle around like a ferris wheel.

"What do you think, Smores?" I ask eagerly, but Smores just excitedly wags its tail.

The door slowly creaks open, cobwebs everywhere. It's as black as midnight. I shine my torch into the emptiness. Something hums. A portal? Something glints. Piles of rare treasures? Something whispers. A shadow man... My heart thumps like a drum and I laugh out loud.

"What an unexpected surprise in an unexpected place!" I cry, a big smile on my face.

Smores scurries up behind me and licks my hand. Even he seems to say 'Wow'. And wow indeed.
