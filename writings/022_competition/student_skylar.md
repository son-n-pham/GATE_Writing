Dogs

Is life a hot-dog eating competition? Should it not be dog-eat-dog? But should there be a top dog? Should the dogs work and dog the top dog? Or should we all work together ignoring top dog titles? Thinking of dogs makes me dizzy. Daily life is either the dogs dog the top dog, or the dogs work together to win the hot dog competition.

Well, competitive dogs could be a good thing. Wanting to beat the top dog creates a big push of effort, a squirt mayonnaise, so every dog will work harder.

However, this might turn into a dog eat dog to be top dog. I understand your head may be spinning like a fidget spinner on a barbeque, but what I am trying to say is competitive dogs maybe a good thing but could cause lots of tension and tears.

On the other hand, dogs working together could release some tension. Cooperating could build strong bonds and unbreakable friendships.

So now, when I ask my self - dogging dogs or cooperative dogs, I believe cooperative dogs is the answer. After all, team work makes the dream work.
