"It's the new iPhone!" People shove their way towards me.
I am blinded by the oncoming rush of camera flashes and the 'oos' and 'ahhs' keep coming around like a ferris wheel.
"Woahh," I say as somebody squeals like a pig. "Chill out buddy!"

Everyone gasps in unison like a many-headed entity.
"It speaks," Someone whispers, breaking the ice.

I brace myself for the tsunami of shrieks, taking deep vibrating breaths. Then everything washes over me like a bucket of icy water.

"I'm gonna buy one!" Cries a woman.
Her eyes are wild and her hair is an orange bird nest. She scrambles to the front of the crowd and presses her big nose against my screen.

"No touching the iPhones," A burly security warns, nodding towards the woman.

The woman just grabs me with her iron grip and yanks me off my stand.
"Get off me!" I shriek. "THIEF!"

The woman grins down at me showing her stained teeth. Security guards come at her from all sides, shades over their eyes.
"Hand me over to them!" I say.
"No!"
"I have to respectfully disagreeâ€”"

A burly security guard plucks me out of the mad lady's grip like I am a feather on a duck.

"Thieves or attempted thievery always comes to a sticky end," I call as I am passed to the store manager and the lady is led away.

I begin to go into lecture mode but at that exact moment the manager turns my power off and I black out.
