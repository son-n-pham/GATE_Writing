As much as I dislike Apple, I will have to admit that they are doing something right.

Today was the first premier release day for the all-new iPhone 20. A huge milestone, yadda-yadda. Better touchscreen, waterproofing to a degree, better speakers and cameras, improved AI features, the whole package.

Honestly, I really don't see what the whole fuss is about. Some people update their iPhones every two years - you wouldn't believe the amount of e-waste I have to sort through! And what is it with the missing headphone jacks? I need headphone jacks! It is all clearly a scheme to force users to spend hundreds of dollars on AirPods, which barely last for a year or two.

But I must digress. I am rambling again.

I will say for the record that I did not want to attend the premier.

I did it because my boss told me to, and we needed to learn all we could from Apple's success.

The crowd was a real, living, breathing beast. All jostling elbows and knees, holding up their much lower model phones to snap photos of the convention before they would inevitably throw them away like pieces of trash to be replaced with the next shiny thing.

Why the hype? I will never understand Apple-lovers.

The room was white and clean. Minimalist, with a single logo of an apple with a bite taken out of it on the wall.

The chatter of the air detracts from the simple design. Heads turning, a sea of dark hair and clothes from black to grey to white to blue to pink. Someone is wearing a full suit and tie. Where does he think he is, a wedding?

From that single convention, I gathered a few nuggets of information:

- Apple is not cheap.
- People will go ridiculous lengths to be the first person to get the new thing.
- Apple is rich.

I shudder to think about the implications for the environment. The poor gorillas!

So why do people fall for it, I ask myself? The question appears, slips into my mind like a cloud.

Because it's trendy. It's flashy. It's new and shiny. People are rather like crows that way. Hoarders that are too smart for their own good, in for the treasure. On a second thought, that describes pirates quite well.

I really do wish they could make up their minds. This is getting rather tiresome.

I still don't know what to tell my boss.

I suppose the lesson I learned is that trends are stubborn mules that people will continually flow with.
