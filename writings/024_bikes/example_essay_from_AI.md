The yellow book lay open on the path, its pages displaying a blurry image of a horse. I glanced at it, then at my friend, Alex, who was already speeding ahead on his white bike. The sun was warm, and the air smelled of cut grass and distant car exhaust. We were supposed to be studying for our history test, but the lure of the park was too strong.

Alex, with his green striped shirt and red shoes, was a blur of motion. I, in my white tank top and reddish shorts, struggled to keep up. The wind whipped through my hair as we raced past the stylized trees and abstract buildings. It felt like we were escaping not just the book, but the whole world of homework and tests.

"Race you to the big oak!" Alex shouted, his voice carried away by the wind.

I laughed and pushed harder on the pedals, the wheels humming against the pavement. The world was a canvas of green, yellow, and red, and we were the artists, painting our own adventure. We didn't need the book, not today. Today, we were free.
