# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "The image depicts two figures riding bicycles away from the viewer on a bright, sunny day. The figures, presumably children or teenagers, are seen from behind and are the central focus of the composition. The figure on the left wears a green striped shirt and shorts, with red shoes. The figure on the right wears a white tank top and reddish shorts, with white socks and shoes. Both have dark hair. They are riding on what appears to be a paved path or road with a light green hue. The background includes stylized trees and some abstract building outlines suggesting an urban or suburban setting. A large book lies open in the foreground, rendered in bright yellow with some illegible text on its pages and an image of an animal, possibly a horse or deer, visible on the left page. The color palette is vibrant, with dominant shades of green, yellow, and white, punctuated by the reds in the cyclist's attire.",
