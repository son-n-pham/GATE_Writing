"Do your homework." Mum stands in the doorway, her wide shape blocking the doorway.

She looks a bit like a yoga ball on legs but I don't dare to speak. Her face is purple and her hands are on her hips. She turns to Muhammad and her expression softened.

"I'm sorry deary but lazy Alex Lee here refuses to do his homework, that naughty boy." She shoots me an infuriated look, not far from the look a rampaging bull gives a red flag.

"You can help Alex if you would like."

Muhammad shrugs and nods respectfully.
"Thanks Mrs Lee," He mumbles, he is clearly scared of Mum.

As soon as Mum disappears behind a door I groan loudly.

"You look sick, Alex." Muhammad says fretfully.

He takes a big yellow book of my desk.
"Might as well start." He dumps the book down and flips the pages.

"You want to study at the park I ask sulkily."
Muhammad shrugs.

We are on our bikes now. Me on my white one, Muhammad on his red one. The wind dances through our hair and the warm afternoon sun bathes our skin.

"Do you think we should leave that bookâ€”"
Muhammad looks sideways at me.

I don't even look back at the thick yellow book lying face down on the gravelly road. I roll my eyes.
"Come on," I joke. "You seriously are worried about that? Race you to the park!"

I laugh as I speed forward past storefronts and over bridges.
"Oi!" Muhammad is catching up.

We both are laughing when we lay sprawled on the grass of the park.
"Better make the most of being kids!" I say.
