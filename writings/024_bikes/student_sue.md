The world is an oven and I am a cookie being baked.

The sun beats down, baking our skin despite being shrouded in a thick curtain of smog.

Maths is a drag, everyone seems too distracted in the large fly buzzing drunkenly in circles around Mr. Singh's head today to care about next week's quiz on fractions.

The bell sounds a reverberating bang of a bell that has us rising from our desks, grabbing bags and shooting out of the door.

I meet Pavitr at the bike shed as always, hair plastered against his forehead in a scruffy cloud.

"I would give anything to have a car right now," he pants, tongue lolling out. "Damn you, bad traffic and climate change!" He raises a fist at the smoky orange sky.

I squeeze the worn leather grip of my bike handle and swing a leg over the seat. "Race you?"

Pavitr wipes his brow. "Whoever gets back wins gets the bag of ice."

"Deal."

The rush of air the ride brings is a welcome sensation, a brief respite against the heat despite my aching legs. We don't even stop today to feed the stray dogs scraps from lunch - stopping would let the heat catch up on us again, creeping back under our skin like a blanket.

We take the short cut through the trees, avoiding the roads choked with smoke and traffic and the far off sounds of chatter and honking cars.

The sun is slowly sinking, a smudge of pink on the horizon.

Pavitr wins, like he always does, but he lets me take a third of the ice anyway.

We gulp down the cold, melted water and rub ice onto our reddened skin.

The heat sucks, but at least we're alive.
