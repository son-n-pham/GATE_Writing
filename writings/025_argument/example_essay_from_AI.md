The flames licked at the edges of my pink shirt, but I barely noticed. Across the small, round table, Beatrice, her red top a stark contrast to the inferno, was mid-sentence. "But why," she insisted, her voice calm despite the fire dancing around her, "would they choose _that_ shade of green for the background?"

I shrugged, the blue of my pants feeling strangely cool against the heat. "Maybe they were trying to make a statement?" I offered, taking a sip from my white mug. The coffee was lukewarm, but it was a welcome distraction.

"A statement about what?" Beatrice scoffed, her black skirt swaying with the movement. "Bad taste?"

"Perhaps," I conceded, watching the yellow flames crawl up her green leggings. "Or maybe it's a metaphor for something deeper."

"Like what?" she asked, raising a perfectly sculpted eyebrow.

"Like how we're always burning, always consumed by something," I said, gesturing to the fire that engulfed us. "Yet, we still manage to have these mundane conversations."

Beatrice paused, her eyes, usually so sharp, softening slightly. "You think so?"

"I do," I replied, a small smile playing on my lips. "We're always on fire, Beatrice. It's just a matter of what we choose to talk about while we're burning."

"I suppose you're right," she said, finally taking a sip of her coffee. "So, about that green..."
