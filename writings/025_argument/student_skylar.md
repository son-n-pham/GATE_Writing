It's been a year since I've seen my younger brother. I sit on the chair, waiting, a mug of coffee in my hand. Dillon walks into the coffee shop, still acting like he owns the place.

I wrinkle my nose and glare at him. "Long time no see," He says, flashing a smug grin at me.

"Just sit down," I snap.

Dillon slides into the chair. He quickly shoves his hand into his lap. He's hiding something.

"You're hiding something, show me," I demand.

A bead of sweat trickles down Dillon's red face. He's like an ugly piece of capsicum.

And then I see it. A cigarette.

"Dillon!" I yell. "You promised never too—"

"Shut up!" He says, the fire in my eyes are reflected into his. "I can live my life—"

"You can't those stick things are the ones that will end your life!"

"So what? I'm alive!"

"Dad always said—"

Dillon stands up and bangs his fist on the wooden table. It looks like he'll explode.

"I want to fit in!" He yells. I can almost see the steam coming from his ears.

"That isn't cool," I storm over and snatch the cigarette from his shaking hands. I snap it and tear it until it is merely dust. Then, I walk over to the bin and dust the stuff off my hands. My expression softens.

"That isn't how you're going to fit in." A smile tickles my lips. "You're going to have to learn from your big sister, Dillon Wyre."
