# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "I see a stylized illustration depicting a group of four people relaxing under a large tree. The scene is set outdoors with a light orange sunset sky, green grass, and a prominent brown tree with a full, green leaf canopy. On the left, a person with brown skin, purple shirt and blue pants is reclining and reading a book. A second red book is lying on the grass beside them. On the right of the tree, three other people are sitting in a circle, engaged in what appears to be a conversation. One person has a yellow dress, the second a red shirt, and the third a purple shirt. The illustration is done in a flat, cartoonish style with thick outlines and textured fills. The colors are warm and muted, with pinkish sky, yellow hues, and shades of green in the grass and leaves, brown for the tree trunk and a red book. There is also a small bird and a sun in the sky.",

  "writing_task_requirements": "The writing task requires students to imagine the conversations the three people might be having and to write a narrative or scene that takes place under the tree, or to write the thoughts of the person reading the book. The image also suggests a need to describe the feelings, or to explain the meaning of the overall mood.",
   "summary": "This image serves as a writing prompt by presenting a peaceful, social scene that can inspire narratives focused on dialogue, character relationships, or internal monologues. The presence of the book can prompt reflection on knowledge and solitude versus togetherness."
