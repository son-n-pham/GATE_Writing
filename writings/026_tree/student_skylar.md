Many think of me as an object to lean against or to seek shade under. I may be a toy - perhaps a swing to be climbed, played on or simply stand. However, I can assure you my story goes deeper than my roots.

Few decades ago, I was a seed, merely a weakling, a baby, a helpless being. I remember that day fondly. From my little nook between the daffodils and the long dancing blades of grass, I spied a girl.

She was so young, perhaps seven, but she looked like the sun come down to earth. A radiant smile nobody else could ever match. Every day, I would watch her frolic in the fields, the sun bathing her freckly face, the grass tickling her toes.

Perhaps it was after a fortnight, but before I knew it, I was cupped in her small hands. She cooed and giggled. Her green eyes were bright and glittering, like two emeralds.

"I'm going to plant you," she announced, her salmon pink cheeks dimpling.

She dug a small hole for me, where I had a beautiful view of where the lush green mountains met the sky, which was always a canvas of neat strokes.

She watered me everyday and talked to me as I grew. She grew too. From a young girl dashing through the grass to a young woman, tall and prim. And one day, she stopped visiting.

I was all alone except for the setting sun and whispering wind. I could not recall her telling me about her departure. She had just left me in the dust. People come and go.

Not long after, the town nearby bloomed to a thriving city, humming like a machine. New visitors. That first little girl still never came back after forty years of waiting. Now, I am no longer waiting for her. I accept my fate. I am waiting to be cut down. Trees come and trees go.
