The sun hangs low in the sky, a ball of red against the endless expanse of fading pink and orange. The clouds are large white puffs ballooning on the edge of the horizon, birds circling lazily as their wings skim the sparse treetops.

Grass shifts under her feet in response to the wind, rippling and tickling her toes.

Her eyes follow the trail of words on paper, dragging across and down and across again. Everything else is filtered into the backdrop of white noise at the back of her mind, the whistle of leaves, hum of cicadas and chattering of people.

Her thoughts wander, chasing away each other, wild and unleashed as they follow the words and build up a storm in her eyes' view.

A turn of a page, a new piece of information sliding into place. The plot thickens like flour into batter.

Different exclamation drift from the other side of the tree, droning on, listless - she is a bee and the book is a flower, feeding her the nectar of its stories, pulling her from the mundane.

Humans are strange, their inventions stranger.

The sun sinks and the shadows grow longer, the sky redder and darker. It is too dark to read.

The girl finishes her page and closes the book to watch the sunset.
