The world is blocked out, my brain is a thick blanket muffling all noise. The classroom is gone. I am no longer trapped between the bars of school, handcuffed to the horror of homework, I am running free in the thick woods, fighting dragons and monsters and persisting against the unfairness of the Capitol.

I swim with dolphins, fly with umbrellas and feast with frogs. Nobody who knocks on the doors of my world could ever understand the complicated conundrum of curious questions, clicking of clockwork and busy bees whiring like cogs in my messy scribbled and doodled over brain. I am lost in a labyrinth and the clock ticks ever faster.

I pay no heed to the recess bell, the monotonous teacher or the cold and bitter wind rattling the window panes. I am alone with my friends—friends so carefully described and carved into the pages of the books I love. I am fending off wolves with a strong and courageous girl adorned with the beautiful name of Belle when someone taps on my shoulder.

Ms. Angèle peers over me, her penetrating ice blue eyes boring into mine. I hurriedly shut my book and look down at my shoes guiltily. Belle disappears, and so do the wolves. The cogs stop turning and the endless treadmill starts running again. I have not yet waved goodbye to my world of fantasy, but alas, you can never escape reality.
