My mind is a bit of a mess sometimes.

You could say that I'm the kind of person with their "head in the clouds", but really, it's not quite the same. It's not a cloud, it's a storm, fluffy and hard and jagged and loud. Most people wouldn't be able to tell by looking at me. It's a relief to know they can't peer into my thoughts. What would they see, I wonder, a collection of words and images. A string of things I can barely comprehend myself, that no one else can read.

Snippets of random information, like cutouts from a newspaper. Colours that race and scratch and scribble, clumsier than a toddler's hand. A collage of a thousand different letters and phrases so intermixed they no longer make sense.

They all have different shades, different pressures and feelings. Some dark and jagged, others looping in crazed, cross-hatching circles.

Sometimes I feel a strange detachment from it all. Like all my thoughts are a tornado brewing in a large glass box in which I sit back and observe with muted interest.

My thoughts have a mind of their own, running off and chasing things without my consent, free as a bird.

They frame everything; or perhaps everything frames them. I watch them race away from me and circle back to join the rest of the herd.

My thoughts are scattered, dark and colourful and blissfully methodical, too large to be contained. They see everything, even though nothing sees me. Ironic, really. But for that, I am glad.

Sometimes I wonder, and it is light as it skims the surface and skips over the pool. Sometimes I dive deeper, until I cannot see the light. It changes from time to time.

I wonder what comes next.
