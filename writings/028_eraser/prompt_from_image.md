  "description": "The image shows a pink rectangular eraser placed diagonally against a background of a blue sky with white clouds and a green hilly landscape. The eraser is the main subject, and it's positioned in the foreground, casting a shadow on the green terrain. The eraser has the text 'Pink Pearl.' written in black cursive on the top surface, along with the words 'Latex FREE!' in smaller block letters. The number '101' is also visible in a smaller font near the bottom of the eraser. The background consists of a blue sky with various sizes of white clouds and a landscape of green hills fading into the distance, and there are also patches of teal in the land. The style appears to be a studio image.",

The specific elements and their unexpected combination are meant to activate imagination and different interpretations of the scene. It could also be a prompt for comparing the scale of the image, or just focusing on the details of the eraser."
