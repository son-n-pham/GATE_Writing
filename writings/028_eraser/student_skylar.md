The eraser rests in my palm. I study the smooth, pink surface then place it on my desk. I have no need for an eraser. I take out a pen and my homework. I sigh as I stare blankly at the endless rows of conundrums. It's as if my brain has stopped working - the gears cogs stiff and unmoving. Ma won't notice if I draw just a little doodle... Before I can stop, my hand dances across the page. I see the ocean stretched before me, soft clouds scudding across the azure sky. Waves the colour of lapis lazuli, vast green fields, mountains that reach up to touch the sky... I am lost in my labyrinth, deaf to the world I live in. My spirit is a flower, blooming among my drawings, weaving in and out of the pages of my sketches. Elaborate monuments loom over me, every intricate detail etched into the page. I am drifting through space, pencil in hand...

"Oi!" Ma grabs my shoulders and shakes me like I am a jar. "What is this nonsense?" she barks, pointing a stubby finger at my homework. A flush crawls up my cheeks and I look down. "Erase your horrendous mess young lady," she snarls. "Guptas never doodle." So I take out my pink eraser and erase my oceans, my fields, my clouds and my mountains. The clock stops ticking and the world I belong to is gone. Life is unfair, and that is a fact.

Now it's formatted as a proper short story with paragraphs, which better reflects its narrative structure. The first paragraph describes the protagonist's daydreaming and drawing, while the second paragraph shows the confrontation with their mother and its aftermath.
