"So, you're... selling stationery now?"

"Don't look at me like that!" Kaye folds her arms defensively but the act doesn't quite hold the flush in her cheeks. "They're erasers! And it's a perfectly valid life mission!"

"Selling erasers. A life vision." I say flatly. "Sounds like a solid mission."

"They're latex free!"

"What is latex anyway?"

Kaye scratches her head. "Not sure. But latex free erasers are always better! I'm even implementing a buy three, get one free strategy!"

"And I'm guessing regular customers get 20% off their toys?"

Her eyes widen, and I resist the urge to slap myself.

The advertisements are made: a giant pink eraser over rolling country fields that stretch to the horizon, blue as the sea.

The pink pearl, she calls it. Pink as a pearl, light as the inside of a shell. Latex free.

On the selling day, the wind is light as a feather, a wisp that breezes through our hair. The stall owners packed and consumers bounce from seller to seller.

The first customer is thin and willowy, hair like a web of blonde. Three erasers, gone. The coins spill. We sell.

Orders roll in, the steady trickle of a stream. Money flows.

Looking back, I suppose I was being too harsh with my dismissal. Pink PearlÂ® has boomed greater than I could have imagined.

It all starts with an idea. With enough resolve, it may even bloom.
