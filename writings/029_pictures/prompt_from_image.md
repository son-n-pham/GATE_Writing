# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "The image is a collage of four separate drawings presented in a grid format. The top-left panel shows a closed red book with a visible red bookmark. The book is rendered with shading to indicate the texture and thickness of its pages. The top-right panel depicts an open umbrella, with its panels in various colors including red, green, light blue, dark blue and black. The handle of the umbrella is a shiny silver, with a distinct curved hook. The bottom-left panel presents what appears to be a ticket, with text and numbers printed on it. A red line diagonally crosses the ticket. The ticket's text reads: '$39.SH GENERAL', '$10.16 APE & IN', '18 & OVER ON', 'HARSHMEL', 'SAT JAN 12 2018 8:' 'WS0532', '99 GROVE - SAN FRANC', '65326', and 'BILL GRAHAM CIVIC AUD'. The bottom-right panel displays a piece of luggage, with horizontal parallel lines giving a sense of the suitcase's texture and shape. The suitcase is dark blue and has a retractable handle extended out.",

    "writing_task_requirements": "The writing task requires students to create a story or descriptive piece that uses all four items (book, umbrella, ticket, and luggage) as part of the narrative, incorporating text from the ticket into the story. Students might be prompted to think about travel, events, or personal journeys, based on the objects shown in the image and the text.",
    "prompt_summary": "This image serves as a prompt by presenting four distinct objects which, together, suggest a travel or journey theme, creating a visual narrative and sparking ideas for a written piece. The details in each drawing offer specific cues, with the ticket text providing explicit context elements that students can weave into their narratives. The combination of a book, an umbrella, a ticket, and a suitcase suggests a story that might involve planning, travel, an event, and a personal story. The objects could be used literally or metaphorically."
