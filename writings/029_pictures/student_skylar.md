Clothes are everywhere. I tip out my entire sock drawer in my desperate search for my lucky socks. My room is like a messed up rainbow, colours clashing like cymbals. Then I spot them - blue against the sea of craziness, clouds printed on the sides. I dive for them and dash like a madman out of my bedroom.

"Hurry up in there!" Mum calls anxiously from the kitchen. “We might be late!"
Our house is a beehive, bursting with life and panic. My diary is tightly clamped in my armpit and my arms are teetering with a pile of clothes. I dump everything on the table.
"The ticket!" Dad is yelling. "We need our ticket!"
I shake my head.
"Our ticket is on my mum's phone!"
But I remember what else I need to find: An umbrella, my favourite book and the blue suitcase.

I hysterically dash around the house, throwing open drawers and kicking open closets. I am now dragging the suitcase across the storm-gray streets, umbrella in one hand and red book under my chin. I hurl everything like balls into my suitcase and soon dad is slamming his foot on the gas pedal. We hurtle like a cheetah in our little yellow van. Just as we step out into the bleak winter morning onto the parking lot, a tall man in a navy shirt and hat steps up to us. He wears a solemn but stern expression—a strange combination.
"Yes?" Dad says a bit rudely.
The man whose uniform makes me suggest he is a police officer. Dad and the man babble on, but the only word I catch is speeding. By the time that is over, we miss the flight to San Francisco. I can say that the moral I learnt is that things don't really go as planned, but as I look with my new wise eyes, what I really learn is to always start to pack a week before your flight.
