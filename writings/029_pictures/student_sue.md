The suitcase drags smoothly on the linoleum floor, wheels clicking. The man walks, suit pressed and clean, baggage in one hand, an umbrella in the crook of his elbow and notebook tucked under an arm. Straight-backed, spotless, a standout against hurrying jetlagged tourists and screaming infants. A voice calls on the intercom. The man takes out his plane ticket and waits in line. He loses the umbrella to be transported separately.

The flight attendant flashes a practiced, white smile like always as she scans the card but internally, her mind is wandering. Must be another Businessman. Wonder why he's heading to Astania, of all places. That city's so dull. Her gaze slides onto the next in the cue, a harassed-looking woman with two toddlers clinging to her legs. She beeps them in.

The plane interior smells musty and a faint, putrid odor hangs in the air, even reaching the first-class area. The man's nose wrinkles slightly at the scent. Must be another vomiting incident from earlier.

He sits, loads his suitcase into the overhead compartment, and buckles himself in. As flight attendants begin to explain life jackets and emergency procedures, he uncaps his pen, opens the notebook and lets the words spill.

The plane rises. The walls shudder. The man writes. He plans, and plots. He doesn't accept any plane food, or get up to take the bathroom. It is just him, the pen and the pages.

Time slows to a crawl.

The man dozes off at some point, awakens to a report about turbulence. He gazes out the frost-covered window. The world outside is cloud and ice.

A part of him wanders, imagines. A great frost dragon, blowing great gales that batter the wings of the plane. He writes.

Planes take you places, he decides. But imagination and a good old pen can take your mind everywhere.

He sleeps, and wakes to sunlight pouring through his window and the pilot announcing the plane's landing.
