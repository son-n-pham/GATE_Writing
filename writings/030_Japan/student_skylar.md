The sun is a red blotch in the pale orange sky. The old traditional Japanese houses are tightly packed together in small neighbourhoods. The cool evening breeze dances through my dark hair and I close my eyes gently, letting the fading sunlight bathe my pale skin.

I check google maps to see where my hotel is, however the results I receive aren't very appetizing. It points out to a vague section of Kyoto, the unfamiliar path to my destination twisting and turning, branching off like an old entangled tree.

I sigh and gently place my phone into my yellow satchel. I'm not afraid. I cautiously approach an old Japanese woman, "Sumimasen— Ellie desu— Sakura Hoteru wa doko desks?” I think back to the years of excruciating frustration of learning a new language and I know it’s paid off. The old woman smiles kindly and points at the supermarket, "Migi!" I can tell she is losing her speech and a pang of guilt hits me.

In thanks, I bow my head and say a few words. I smile. Never before have I ever recognised the true importance of learning a new language. I grin pleasantly as I head to the right of the supermarket, the little birds soaring above me under the canvas of orange strokes which is the setting sky.
