Gravel crunches underfoot on the hard cobblestone ground. The sun hangs low, almost orange in the light of the pale setting sky, buildings casting long, dark shadows.

Several people are milling aimlessly in the street, tourists, by the looks of it. A scattered collection of shirts and hoodies and sneakers phones out or examining each building with an expression of vague interest. A couple young women with lipstick, prettily done makeup and kimonos playing fake geishas and posing in front of wooden traditional-looking buildings for their instagram photoshoots. Pretending to drink in the Japanese culture like the vloggers they are.

The buildings are old, carefully made, collections of sharp-carved stone and brickwork roofs curved and pointed in that well-known Japanese way. Bushes with thousand of tiny oval-shaped leaves spilling from yards.

I'll admit that I am not a local. Rather, a part-time tourguide that does their best making the money I can, but tourists do not intrigue me. Their goals seem surface-level at best, a collection of tickboxes, places to see, hoping in a positive result relaxation, maybe. Honestly, they might as well go to Tokyo Disneyland for all the care they have. They ask questions about culture hoping to feel enlightened, and instead internally cringe at my bad Japanese accent.

The stone has long since been worn away by several sets of heavy feet, not unlike the erosion seen in caves and beaches. Big cities and fancy

places are full to bursting with tourists while the "lesser" cities are reduced to forgotten ghost towns. Tokyo this, Tokyo that. It's always Tokyo. I don't see the fuss.

As time passes, I hold tours. Trace the usual path down the streets. Tell the kids not to touch the statues. Remind them to take their shoes off.

In the long run, a little more interest and respect would be nice. Greatly appreciated. But then again, who am I to complain? I am only a tour guide.
