# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "The image shows a small, two-story house suspended in mid-air, seemingly held up by thin cables. The house is a light beige color with a red tiled roof. It has four windows, each with white frames and flower boxes filled with pink and yellow flowers. A single bird is perched on the roof's peak. The background is a muted, pale sky with subtle cloud formations. There is a street light attached to one of the cables on the left side of the image. The bottom of the house appears to be flat and featureless. Overall, the house appears to float against the sky backdrop.",
