"Weather's fine today." Peleus peers through the brass eyeglass of the weather map. "Bit cloudy in this area, heading south-ish, some wind going..." He squints harder, leathery wrinkled skin crinkling at the eyes. "Twelve k's. Not too sunny. All aboard the flying house!"

"You sure this thing is safe?" Kayla's knuckles are white as she grips the table and peers out the window at the tiny pinpricks of buildings clumped together miles below.

"Twenty thousand leagues above the sea!" Peleus chuckles, dragging the telescope closer to the flower box outside.

"Gramps, I'm pretty sure it's below the ocean, not above"

A wii stick controller is thrust into her arms.

"You control the flight trajectory while I hang up the washing, eh?" Peleus doesn't wait for an answer, turning on his creaky legs to grab his old aviator helmet.

"Uh... Grandpaâ€”"

"Eyes on the map!" The old man hops out of the pilots chair and totters out, wobbling like a rickety staircase as he whistles to himself and crosses the room.

The door slams shut.

Kayla sits, the controls clenched tight in her fists. She hates heights.

She drags in a deep breath, can almost imagine her lungs rattling like a coin in a can.

Stay calm. Don't freak.

She holds the controller, imagining the steady cruise of their quaint American-dream house sailing smoothly through the winds like a seal through water. Easy. Easy goes...

Peleus' voice, crackling in a sudden croak through the intercom. "Migrating geese ahead! Steer clear!"

Kayla jumps, and the house jumps with her, a sudden jolt that spikes her pulse.

She narrowly misses them, scatters a flock of startled birds from their carefully arranged wing formation. She tears through the flock and they part in panicked waves.

They only just make it to their final destination.

Peleus pats her on the back as she wills her ears to unpop.

"Don't worry, kid. Practice takes time."

The sun winks at them through a patch of clouds, and it is gone again.
