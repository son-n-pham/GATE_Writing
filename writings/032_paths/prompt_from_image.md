  "description": "The image depicts a small, two-story house suspended in the air against a pale sky. The house is box-shaped with a tan or beige facade, a red-tiled pitched roof, and four rectangular windows with white frames and curtains. Each window has a flower box with vibrant pink and green flowers. The house is held aloft by thin black wires that stretch diagonally from the four corners of the house and connect to the top of the image. There is a bird perched on the peak of the roof and a small red lamp hanging from the wire near the left side of the house. The background is a light, cloudy, orange/peach sky. There is no text visible in the image.",
