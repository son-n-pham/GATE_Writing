The little houses sat like cats on a wall - still and unmoving. Pip walked along the jetty, humming softly to herself, barefooted and in a blue swim suit. Sea water dripped from her brown pigtails onto the old wooden jetty. Pip looked at the house in front of her with her keen hazel eyes. Nine modest houses bobbing on the water like jetty buoys, only connected to land by a thin rotten jetty that had mould and algae growing on the rickety unstable legs. Right in front of Pip, the jetty split like a tree into two separate 'roads' leading to the houses, parts breaking off like twigs.

Pip sighed as she sat herself on the edge of the jetty, dangling her legs into the cool, refreshing water. She gazed up at the canvas of blue and yellow strokes above her. She loved her sealife. The breeze danced through her hair and small silver fish leaped out of the azure water. Pip loved her sealife. Everyone thought she was a city girl, like most people, a person who enjoys the bustle of the heart of Australia, but Pip hated the feeling of being boxed into a box crammed with hundreds of other people. Instead, she belonged with the ocean, the jellyfish, the sand, the seashells, and her humble abode, a house out to sea where she could blissfully enjoy everything she loved. The puzzle piece inside of her that was unique, the piece of her that made her who she was.
