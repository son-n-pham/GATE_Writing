The rickety wooden planks groan unsteadily underfoot. Waves slap at the support poles, crusted over with seaweed and barnacles. The air filled with the crisp tang of salt and fish.

I close the door of my house, cradling several buckets, a large net and three fishing poles ("The third is for emergencies!" Gramps had said).

Gramps totters in front of me in his bermuda shorts and old navy jacket, whistling some odd sea shanty as he swings the rope over his shoulder. Practically bouncing on his feet, sprightly as a dolphin despite the creaking limbs.

The boat bobs, tethered to a particularly chunky plank protruding from the rest, an old metal bathtub of a thing called Betty.

"Reliable as always," Gramps slaps the hull lovingly.

The boat rocks as we climb in, saltwater splashing up into my face.

"Pass me the knife, will you, sonny?" Gramps calls, his voice a rough old croak. Gramps cuts the rope.

As always, he passes me the oars. "Good for yer arm muscles," he says with a wink. My knuckles are red and swollen, arms like aching, gangly spider legs from rowing.

"Endurance is good for the heart," he tells me at the end of the day, like always when we drag our nets of flopping fins and scales, up onto the jetty. To the market it goes. "There's no use slackin' off. Gotta earn yer keep."

He's right, of course, like always.

Hard work usually pays off, in the end.
