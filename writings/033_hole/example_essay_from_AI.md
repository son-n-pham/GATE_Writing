Bartholomew Buttonsworth was not having a good day. It had started with a burnt piece of toast, and had only gone downhill from there. He was late for his very important meeting, and was rushing down the street, his briefcase swinging wildly. He was so focused on not being late that he didn't notice the bright orange traffic cones scattered around a gaping hole in the sidewalk. He tripped over one, and with a yelp of surprise, tumbled headfirst into the hole. His legs stuck up in the air, his socks a comical sight against the grey concrete. He landed with a thud, his briefcase landing on top of him. He lay there for a moment, dazed, before realizing the absurdity of his situation. He had fallen into a hole. He sighed, and began to climb out, brushing the dirt off his suit. He was even later now, but he had learned a valuable lesson: always watch where you're going.
