  "description": "The image depicts a cartoon illustration on a light tan background. A person in dark pants, black socks, and a partially visible blue and white shirt is falling headfirst into a dark circular hole in the ground. Their legs are sticking up in the air, and small motion lines are used to give the sense of falling.  There is a small white star-burst near the hole, indicating a sudden impact. Two small white exclamation points are floating above the legs. Three orange and white striped traffic cones are scattered around the hole, one laying on its side to the left, and two standing upright to the right. The background also shows a couple of simple white clouds at the top of the frame.",
