Pip didn't notice the cones - or the hole. Her hazel eyes reflected the bright, blue screen of her phone. The wind danced through her choppy brown pigtails and came back to slap her face over and over again. Pip was oblivious, she was glued to her screen, a fish that had been reeled in by social media. The city around her was a humming beehive brimming with loud people, cars and the deafening honking of horns arguing like geese. The sky above her was a thick blanket of white clouds, not far from the blanket that parted Pip and her phone from the rest of the world. She didn't notice that she was walking red lights, and infuriated barks of the car drivers. The flood of 'likes' were threatening to pull her under, bit by bit. That's when she bumped into the cone.

Her eyes looked up for a split second, and the clouds seemed to part for just a moment, but Pip's eyes flitted downwards and the clouds resumed their job of blotting out the sun. That's when Pip fell into the hole. Pip swore very loudly and no doubt, ruined two things: her language and her clothes. The hole was not very deep, but was covered in an unpleasant mix of cold, wet cement and earthy scented dirt - along with the occasional fist full of sand. Pip's new yellow satchel was covered in sticky cement and her hair looked like it was greying with the sand. However, Pip's eyes filled with tears as she saw her phone - cracked and filthy under her foot. She had stepped on her own phone. Pip howled in despair.
