Nestor was having a bad day.

The weather was pleasant for once, the smog and rain cleared away to reveal a clear expanse of cerulean blue, with just a dash of clouds. The sun was out, merrily casting rays of golden light that spilt through the windows like honey.

Which was precisely the problem.

The sun out meant that it was well into morning which meant that Nestor was very late for work.

His morning became a mess of an affair white shirt wrinkled, no time to iron, hem stuffed into his belt, tie strangling, blazer a size too large. Damn you, washing machine. Breakfast was virtually none-existant.

Nestor ran, subsequently creasing his nicely polished work shoes. The bus fled from him, tail lights disappearing around the corner flashing mockingly at him. The bus driver did not see him.

Nestor ran. Nestor fell.

Into a hole, seven foot deep to be exact.

His foot had connected with a traffic cone. Panic had set in, a quick burst in his stomach that had him digging his heels into the gravel.

Momentum tipped the scale, carrying him stubbornly forward, and down.

Nestor hit his head.

A dull ringing had filled his ears, blotting out all sounds of traffic. A cold, slimy, nauseous sensation crawled over him, the horrible realisation that he wasn't just late, he was in real trouble.

It twisted in his stomach, coiling like a snake. It was irrational, but there.

Nestor called for help until his voice scratched itself raw. No one heard over the roar of a truck.

Despair overtook him in a wave. There was dirt, dirt! On his precious tie! His blazer was ruined! It wasn't until midday when the dirt had nearly baked itself to clay when he remembered that he did, in fact, have a phone.

He called an ambulance, and was picked up soon after.

It turns out his injuries were not nearly as lethal as he'd assumed. The paramedic patted him on the shoulder, offered a sticker and told him to be less clumsy in the future.

Nestor missed work that day, and learned a valuable lesson.
