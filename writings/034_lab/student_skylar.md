"Is this supposed to help my lab studies?" Pip asks skeptically as she examines what seems to be a thick metal tube with a spout and a complicated conundrum of wires and levers. Pip puts on a pair of safety goggles and blue gloves. I nod.

"Yeah the guy selling the stuff said so." I say. "Something about germs playing lacrosse? I still know what it is."

Pip sighs and shakes her head, her mane of long brown hair flying around her.

"Honestly Katrina, I'm not a biology know-it-all." Pip straightens her white lab coat and cautiously fiddles with the buttons.

"It's Kat." I mumble.

Pip ignores me and takes out her phone. She snaps a picture of the metal tube and looks it up. I stifle a giggle.

"Honestly, Pip, do you not know what it is?"

Pip almost growls at me, like a dog whose so angry it can't even bark. I laugh and fetch a red plastic cup from the kitchen along with a small spoon.

"Honestly," I say again as I press a lever and cold, sweet, refreshing vanilla gushes out of the water spout and into my cup. I take my hand off the lever and demolish my ice cream in seconds. The anger seems to weedle out of Pip like air in a balloon. She throws her safety goggles away and soon we are feasting on the glorious ice cream.

"You think too much," I say between a mouthful of icecream.

Because Pip is so stuffed, all she can do is nod and say "Mmm..."
