Safety goggles, check. Gloves, check. Lab coat, check.

I peer down the strange metal tube contraption a the ventilation holes and grates. Right. So. Figuring out the secret to the latest vacane should be easy.

The grate stares back, a button blinking mockingly.

I can feel the eyes of the camera glaring at me, a sensation like ants crawling along my skin.

"Hm..." I say thoughtfully. "Fascinating... uh, aerodynamics." My pits are sweating under the heavy cotton fabric.

The camera man zooms in, unapologetic.

My mind is screaming internally as I school my expression into one of careful interest, as a scientist should.

The truth is I'm screwed. I have no clue what I'm doing, I'm itchy, uncomfortable, confused...

"So, Dr Belinda," the reporter says, giving me an indulgent smile that's all blinding white teeth. "How is your work study going?"

"Just fascinating," I say again, because that seems like the kind of thing a scientist might say. Fascinating. Did that sound sarcastic?

The reporter nods. She seems to look like she understand better than I do. "Care to explain?"

"Noble gases are stable," I blurt. The only bit of scientific jargon my brain can cough up. My thought move sluggishly like running through mud. "But it makes it... unstable."

The reporter nods. Damn it, she's taking notes. Internally, I'm struggling to telepathically message the real Dr Belinda to get her posterior here immediately. I don't know how much longer I can keep up the charade.

The reporter continues. I rattle off strands of disjointed information, hypothalamus, photosynthesis, synaptic knobs. Time slows to a crawl.

Looking back, I think I can say I learned an important lesson.

Next time, I'll think twice when Belinda asks me to cover for her.
