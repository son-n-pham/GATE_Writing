The sun bathed Lot's golden fur. Colourful butterflies danced around, but Lot was focused on the frisbee. He yipped playfully as the frisbee soared like a bird across the rows of neat bushes, which were bursting with flowers of all shapes and sizes.Lot took a big leap of faith, flying over a row of regal violets.

In mid air, he paddled forwards like he was swimming in mid air. As the iron grip of gravity started to yank Lot down, he howled in frustration, only just managing to slightly touch a paw to the frisbee's plastic surface. Lot refused to give up. He dashed through sunflowers and trampled hyacinths in his quest to catch the frisbee, which was caught in the long dancing breeze and flew ever faster across the flowery fields.

Lot felt like he was going to collapse. He was panting heavily and his tail dropped sadly. But then, Lot shook away all of the hopelessness and pessimism out of him and gathered the remainder of his strength and powered on, and against all odds the frisbee was soon in Lot's paws, the little plastic toy a memorable reminder that if you push on and stay strong, you will achieve something great, just like Lot, the determined dog.
