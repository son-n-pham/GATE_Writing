Sunshine and flowers and butterflies and meadows. Cerulean blue skies with a dash of fluffy clouds. Grass stretching green and far as the eye can see, tall trees and greenery coexisting like a single, living, breathing thing.

The ideal world, one might say. Clean air and a rainbow of flowers for all. Fruit that breaks cool and fresh and succulent.

A cluster of perfect hyacinths rustle and part, a youth ball of fur and energy leaping through, yapping joyously and frolicking among the sunflowers and bees, free of stingers with delicate bodies soft from striped fuzz.

The puppy barks, a high, playful sound coat of fur splotless and golden, blooming in its health.

A yap, another, it chases its tail, quick as the wind leaps over a cluster of hydrangeas and howls in delight as a butterfly, fragile and delicate as glass, perches on the edge of its nose.

And so time passes, or does it? The sun never dips, it shines bright and golden and the moon makes no appearance.

The clouds glide lazily by, resuming its daily crawl across the sky, never ceasing. Grass ripples in the gentle, ever-present breeze.

The puppy plays, and does not stop. It does not rest or whimper or sleep or long for its siblings. Night never comes, so the puppy must play forever.

The same flowers, the same sun, the same sky. The puppy bounces and ventures far in its playful restless state and the fields stretch on endlessly, each component perfect and matching.

The puppy doesn't know that it is being watched, or that nothing at all is real. A pair of lens follow, ever-present.

Intelligence shifting behind the machines.

The puppy wanders. Is it happy? It doesn't know. Suppose it is. But what is happiness when one has nothing to compare it to?

A button clicks.

The simulation ends.
