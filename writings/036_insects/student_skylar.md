In the animal kingdom everything is so tight and lively. The plain-looking fields burst with life, for fields are not only tall blades of dancing grass or twirling flowersâ€”the fields are a place of caution and quick-thinking. The snakes come out to play in summer, slithering cunningly among the high yellowing grass and weeds, quick and energetic as a lion to gobble down an innocent unknowing mouse.

In winter the snakes go away, replaced by the unrelenting and cruel thunderstorms, raging across the fields, striking down trees and flattening insects and birds, just like an angry giant. Spring is a time of very slight relief. The butterflies fly about, shaking the heavy droplets out of their wings, and the snakes blearily slide out of their nests.

However, animals still exercise caution. Everywhere, animals are wearily studying each other, hesitating every second. Are they friend or foe? Prey or predator? Nowadays, us humans seem to have much easier lives than the hardworking animals. I can say some of us roam the fields, but our lives are not as horrible. When I spy a stranger, I never really wonder if they are a friend or foe.

Seasons for humans are really just the same. I have never seen a snake slither on a sidewalk. Thinking of this reminds me how lucky I am being born a human. This may sound absurd, but I could've been born as a praying mantis, and at this second am facing off a suspicious moth. I am not sure.

All I can be is extremely grateful. I would much rather the city over the fields. I hope I am not rambling, but I look looking at a stranger curiously not cautiously.
