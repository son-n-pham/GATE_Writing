Leaves quiver in the soft wind sending ripples through the trees.

It moves, the flap of tiny, delicate wings brown and orange like autumn's leaf speckled with black. The slightest warming shift in the air sends it fluttering, antennae as it flits away like a runaway petal, lighter than a breeze.

Its eyes are huge and dark against the small head, big and black like the flicker of miniscule camera lens.

The moth lands, tiny legs touching down on the hairy stem of a flower bright red and overpowering in its rich, perfume taste.

Wings flickering gently, it crouches, its soft, furry grey body crouching.

There it stays, wills its wings to rest.

A sort of haze follow, a halt in the system where it does not move, the barest twitch of a leg, flick of a wing. A coma-like trance that follows in its wake.

It doesn't feel much of anything at all, but there it is again, a bounce. The stem trembles.

One antennae twitches.

The moth is not alone.

It stirs sluggishly, senses working blearily. Something is there; what is it? It can smell it, a bitter shift. Something vaguely blurs in and out of focus. A worm? A late-blooming flower bud? No, that is not it.

The stem moves, something long, thin, spindly as a spider. The click of pincers.

The moth is awake. Its tiny heart is beating, pounding. Wings vibrate. Its leg moves. A step back.

The creature moves forward. Come on, it seems to say invitingly. I am a friend. Come and play.

The moth does not want to play.

The stem shakes again. The moth is backed up against the flower. Its wings are shivering in a frenzy.

Move! Its brain tells it. Fly!

The praying mantis lunges with the force of the wind, legs outstretched, teeth jutting for the kill.

The moth flies. A second later, and it would have become a tasty meal.

Sometimes, one needs to act first.
