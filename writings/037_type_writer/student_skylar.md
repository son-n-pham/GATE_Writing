Her fingers were the legs of a spider, scuttling frantically over the keyboard. It was the beginning of The Great American Novel. Ionna had never set foot on American soil. Her boots were firmly planted in Ukraine, the place where her imagination blossomed and bloomed. Through her carefully carved poetry, she could escape.

She was in America on a dark and stormy night, with the air so still, with foreign American laughter echoing off the tall skyscrapers. The rain would pitter-patter on the pavement. She dances, she swings, she laughs, she sings. It is a dark and stormy night. And everything will be alright.

Ionna decided The Great American Novel was going to be filled to the brim with Great American poems of her inventions, a Great American Orchestra conducted by herself.

And with that last final encouraging idea, Ionna finished the very first line of The Great American Novel.

Her very own private jet plane had just arrived in America, and her journey had begun with only six bold words. Words that truly helped her imagination soar. Words that were escape tunnels. Words that showed what imagination was truly capable of:

"It Was A Dark And Stormy Night."

The Great American Novel,
By Ionna.
