"It was a dark stormy night"

I remember staring at the words I had just printed cursor blinking up at me mockingly. I could vaguely recall fragments of the dream but they were disjointed and incomplete, a jumble of letters that could spell out the right story if only a I had a dictionary.

It was night, I was sure. It was dark and it was stormy. There had been rain, sheets of it, hammering down like a thousand whips. Or had it really? Perhaps it was only a drizzle, a crackle in the air. What was the storm, thunder? Rain? Lightning? Or all three.

Why call it dark and stormy, anyway? Surely there were better synonyms. Isn't it a little clich√©? All I wanted to do was write, but the words eluded me. They were sneaky like that, like hovering bait - it was there when I expected it least, perhaps struggling to sleep in bed, but it always fled when the time came like a fever dream water slipping through my fingers and only the dampness that made an impression on me.

Some days I found myself so demotivated I could scarcely drag my sack of a body out of bed, let alone withstand the sight of the dreaded keyboard.

Time crawled by, slow as a snail and it would suddenly crash in a tidal wave, an entire week passing with little progress.

I stared at the almost-empty document, and the words stared back, cruel and unforgiving.

I must write, I urged myself. I must write.

I pulled my laptop to me and typed, the words stilted and awkward. It did not spill like it might on a good day, and a good day had not come to me in a long time.

I finished writing and I could have collapsed. My hands ached, cramping from exertion. Perhaps it was all simply psychological, a trick of the mind. I close the glow of the screen and in its absence my eyes were sore and dry but not tired.

I lay in bed and once more the words came to me, and slipped away when I finally woke, itching for a pen.

I read the book I had written.

To say it was terrible was an understatement. The words swam haphazardly, criss-crossing over eachother with no meaning. Gibberish. Truly pathetic, I thought to myself in despair.

I had named the manuscript "The Great American Novel" though in truth it was neither great, nor American nor a novel. It was a poor excuse of a novella, barely spanning fifty pages.

I myself was not American. I had never been there. I did not like hamburgers, or pizzas, or whatever Americans ate. It just so seemed that all the successful authors were either British or American, some way or the other in which I was none.

I deleted the words, they were soulless to me.

That was how my first novel went. I've moved on since then, learned to motivate myself.

Really, I think the most important lesson I learned was to know when I needed to clean the slate and start over.
