# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "The image depicts a person, presumably a man, with light skin, wearing a bright yellow short-sleeved button-up shirt with large pink flower designs, along with white shorts and flip-flops, seated on the edge of a grey bed or low couch. He is facing to the right and using a black marker to write tally marks on a vibrant, pink, floral wallpaper. The wallpaper has a repeated pattern of hibiscus-like flowers. To the left of the figure, there is a window showing a green palm tree silhouette against a bright blue background, suggesting a sunny tropical setting. The room has a color palette of pink, red, yellow, green, white, blue and a hint of black. There is no text in the image.",
    "task_requirements": "The writing task implied by the image could explore themes of isolation, monotony, counting down days or events, or waiting for something. It might ask writers to create a narrative around the person in the image, speculating about the context or motivations of their actions, why they are making the marks on the wall. It could explore a character's response to confinement or a change in routine.",
    "prompt_summary": "This image provides a visual prompt centered around the mystery of the man counting days, inviting creative writing about his situation, emotions, the place where he is or his plans for the future. The setting (bright wallpaper, palm tree seen through the window) creates a contrast to the implied solitude. It also invites the author to speculate and answer why the man might be counting marks on the wall."
