House arrest. what a stupid punishment, No-room arrest. I wonder who invented it. Now I'm counting the days until I can be freed out of my dreadful prison. I hope Gramma won't mind the permanent marker I've pressed onto her flowery pink walls. Eleven long days of room arrest. Just three more to go.

Three more days of absolutely nothing. The days seem to be mocking me. The clock's face jeers at me, it's hands making rude gestures.

I am desperate for entertainment, thirsty for at least a book. Just great. Thinking of books makes me remember why I have been placed under room arrest. All because of an annoying book. It bugs me like a fly. In this state, I would go to any lengths to get my hands on a book, but that chance has slipped through my fingers like water.

It embarrasses me to think this but I would want to read Great Expectations now. The book that got me in trouble.

It all started with Gramma, slapping a big leather bound book onto my table, She rattled on in her frog like croak of hers about a note from my teacher and how they I have to read the book or face 'problems'.

I had no idea what my tough, squat tiny Gramma could do until she shoved me in my room and took away all of the books, I had suddenly felt small against Gramma as her words boomed like thunder. I guess I could've learnt that I should read every book Gramma sets out for me, but what sticks is never underestimate people, especially if they're short wrinkly and old.
