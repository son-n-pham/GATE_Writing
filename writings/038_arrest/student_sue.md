The hawaiian shirt is bright yellow, gansh as the sun and plastered with hot pink flowers.

The room is respectable. Something an hopeful tourist might expect of a luxury 5 star hotel room in a tropical island on the Mediterranean. The walls are pink and red as beach flowers, and patterned with them too. The bed is clean, grey, a fair sized single bed with two pillows stuffed with fine downing.

The view is nice, a rich stretch of blue and green, ocean and beach and palm trees.

The man has lived in this room for as long as he can remember; before that, there is not much else.

The sun never quite seemed to set for long, or if it did, he was asleep.

He'd tested the glass before it was thick, and hard. The chair had not made a single dent in it.

These days the man might lie of his bed and read, whatever showed up on the shelf. Or he might go downstairs and call for room service, stay in the spa and pop soap bubbles large as his face while invisible hands probed his feet, molding, massaging the toes, the fleshy part of the heels.

He might go to the indoor swimming pool and float listlessly while staring up at the stretch of sky visible in the skylights.

He lost track of time. At some point, he tried, scratched a line onto the floral wall of his room with a marker but he found himself simply forgetting. Every now and then he would remember again, frown at the lines and forget how to count. All the ink stains he had procured on his fingertip always disappeared the next morning.

He felt it again, the nagging sense of curiosity or concern? Fear? What was it? It started as a spark and grew in his stomach like a beast but it wasn't hunger. All the chicken drumsticks in the hotel would not make it go away.

It was a sense of unease, perhaps. Of the smoothness of it all. How the building bent at his touch and moved to fulfil his every need, but still it would not let him leave. Almost a living, breathing thing the hotel seemed, a mouse trap with the man as its spoilt prey. It toyed with him, doted over him. When would the cycle break?

A gilded cage is still a cage, as some may say.

The man was forgetful, but not ignorant.
