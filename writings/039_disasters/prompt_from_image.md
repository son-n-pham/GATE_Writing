# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "The image depicts a dramatic scene of a coastal area under siege by various natural disasters. The focal point is a cliff with several houses perched on top, all protected by a large, translucent dome. Surrounding this protected area are chaotic elements: a massive tornado approaches from the right, violent ocean waves crash against the cliff base, and a volcanic eruption spews fire and smoke on the left, along with visible lightning in the sky. The houses are rendered in a simple, cartoonish style with various colors, including yellow, red, blue, and white, contrasting with the darker tones of the sky and the stormy seas. The cliff itself is orange-brown, with green foliage along the edges. The color palette is diverse, using dark blues and grays for the sky, orange for the cliff and the explosion, and white and blue for the waves and the dome. There is no visible text in the image.",
  "writing_task_requirements": "The writing task implied by the image requires creativity and descriptive skills. Students could write stories about people living in the houses under the dome and how they are dealing with this emergency situation. The implied requirements are to focus on character development and interactions, imaginative scenarios, storytelling, and descriptive use of a variety of elements including natural disasters, technology, and human resilience.",
    "prompt_summary": "This image serves as a writing prompt by presenting a complex, imaginative scenario with contrasting elements. The image combines natural disasters, a high-tech protection dome, and an implied story of the people within that space. It allows students to explore themes of safety versus danger, human resilience, the power of nature, or dystopian scenarios, and encourages descriptive writing by providing multiple visual elements to describe and expand on. It can be approached from a variety of angles (sci-fi, fantasy, realistic fiction) and can be used to prompt diverse narratives."
