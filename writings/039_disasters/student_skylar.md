The waves roared and reared up like infuriated horses. The sky was split as lightning lit up the sky like dangerous fireworks. And at the same time, He fire danced closer.

Just as the fire licked the little town it went out. It was as if someone had turned it off, leaving behind a feebly crackling bed of embers.

In the safe dome of the town, life droved on as usual. Buildings nestled safety like eggs on the cliff protected by a single dome.

It was a place not even the tornadoes could swallow up.

The weather forecast was dull. Sunny skies in the city tsunami warning outside.

Pip switched off the television. She sighed gloomily as a tyrannical tornado raged outside. She thought back to the weather report Natural disasters dancing around wasn't new, it was common, everyone knew the dome was a steel shield.

But Pip wouldn't let her guard down.

She remembered the textbooks she had to study- thick unreadable books with annoyingly small print. All she had managed to pick up was once, the dome had cracked, centuries ago.

Everyone assured her nothing would happen, the dome would never crack.

But it did.

It was that night and a tsunami was repeatedly bashing the dome. Over and over again. Pip's heart was a bass drum as she lay in bed, worry etched in her mind.

Then there was a loud drip.

And a crack.

And the roof of the dome fell in.

The night was silent for just a single heartstopping moment and time froze.

Then came the water. Crashing in. An untamed, wild wave. A rogue. There was chaos. Big white words flashed before her in her mind. IT CRACKED.

She flew out of bed in a state of panic. She knew it would happen. She knew. Someday. Running barefoot across the halls, Pip shrieked.

There was water up to her thighs. She didn't know where to go, what to do. She just knew it had happened. She was the only one who had suspected.

They all let down thier guard. It made her do the same. And they were doomed.
