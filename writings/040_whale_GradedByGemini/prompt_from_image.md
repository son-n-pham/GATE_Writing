# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "The image is a split view showing the surface and underwater world. Above the waterline, there's a person sitting on a light-colored paddleboard or surfboard, wearing a long-sleeved blue top and a red hat, set against a backdrop of a cloudy sky with varying shades of grey and white. The sky appears muted, with soft tones suggesting either early morning or late evening light. Below the waterline, two large whale sharks are the main focus, their massive bodies and spotted patterns are clearly visible in the deep blue water. The light underwater is subdued, contrasting with the brighter surface. The sharks are positioned at different depths, with one slightly closer to the viewer than the other. The overall scene conveys a sense of vastness and the coexistence of humans and marine life. The image has a balanced composition, with the waterline acting as a clear divide.",
