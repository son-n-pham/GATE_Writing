Pip was unfamiliar with the canoe. It was like a new instrument she couldn't use, the paddle felt heavy in her calloused palms and her arms ached. She was uncomfortably itchy as the salt water got under her clothes.

Her eyes scanned the horizon. All she could see was sea, stretching out like a vast blanket. She felt foggy.

The canoeing teacher said they were supposed to meet up someone. Pip rolled her eyes and kept rowing, trying to ignore the searing pain that pierced her arm like a stab of electricity. "Just keep go-" Pip shrieked as her boat was tossed aside. Her stomach was churning as fast as the dark water.

Her heart was a bass drum that would not slow down. Her arms were lightning, suddenly maneuvering the boat like it was a car.

Her arms, her body, her mind was numb. All she could think about was getting away. Getting away from the dark shape cutting swiftly through the water.

Pip tried to move fast but she was a tortoise compared to the beautiful and deadly creature that gracefully rose to the surface.

When Pip saw the whale, she didn't know what to think. Should she be running? Her breathing slowed slightly but her heart kept its rhythm.

The whale stared at her, gliding silently beside her canoe. The more Pip looked at its big, gentle eyes, the slower her heart beat. Her movements slowed too. The whale examined Pip curiously and Pip did the same.

The whale's eyes reflected the pale sky and Pip's calm expression. "Maybe," Pip whispered, "You're not that dangerous after all."
