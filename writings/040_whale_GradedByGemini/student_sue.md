Water slaps against the plastic hull of the kayak, an echoing, almost hollow sound that makes me think of metal buckets and pails.

The wind is slightly rougher today, cold on my exposed knuckles, red and swollen from exhaustion. The strong scent of sea salt fills my nostrils.

My arms ache a little but I move them methodically, like a windmill, dipping the paddle in, drawing it back, left, right, repeat.

My body settles into a sort of lull, allowing my mind to wander. The day's catch, the wave heights, the speed of the wind.

A tiny drop of rain lands on my cheek, a pinprick of wetness on my skin. I stick out my tongue, trying to catch the sparsely placed raindrops the way a child might catch a snowflake.

I feel a bump on the boat, a sudden jerk of movement. My hands still on the oars.

Thump.

The boat rocks.

Along with the constant lap of waves with the wind, I can see the water

Here's the extracted text from the image:

eddying outwards in a circular motion.

Thump.

I look down.

Something moves, directly under me. A large, dark shape three times the size of my boat. I make out the speckle of spots of grey skin.

It moves, gliding almost lazily.

Not just it, they. There are two of them.

I watch, entranced. The slow, deliberate shift of its great fins. The way the skin moves, ripples as its muscles move. The steadiness of its tail. A gentle giant.

The pair of whalesharks pass and I watch them, the shadow of their form distorted through the ocean that separates us.

I think it sees me, a careful blink of its eyes. A nod of acknowledgement.

I sat in my kayak, still and awestruck, watching them pass.

How old are they? I wondered. Are they mates? Siblings? Or two whale sharks who happened to be taking the same journey? What is their life like? What have they seen?

They intrigued me, and they still do now.
