# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "The image shows a man interacting with a bronze statue of a seated man. The statue is on a bench and is holding a newspaper. The man is standing and leaning towards the statue's face as if he is whispering or talking. The statue is dark grey-bronze color. The man is wearing a light brown jacket, blue jeans, and black athletic shoes. The background includes a red brick wall and a light grey stone or pavement ground.  The ground appears to be made of two different materials:  one which is a cobblestone-like texture behind the bench, and the other a brick patterned area in front of the bench. There are no visible text in the image, and the colors are mostly neutral, with the brown of the jacket and red of the brick being the most vibrant. The main subject is the interaction between the real person and the statue, which creates a humorous and somewhat surreal scene.",
  "writing_task": "The writing task requires the students to use their imagination and creativity by writing a story or dialogue around the interaction between the real man and the statue.
