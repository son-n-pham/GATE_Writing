The statue stared back at me. I didn't know a stone figure could have such a human expression. It was sitting on the bench, a wordless newspaper on his rusty lap. I peered over my glasses at it like a scientist.

"Howdy," The statue said.

I jumped back in complete disbelief. I poked the statue's shoulder.

Hard cold and dusty. I blinked.
"Howdy," I said.

I felt crazy as I sat down on the bench next to the statue and waited. For what?

There was a pause. No sound, except from the soft hum of the happy city. I thought the statue's stone lips wouldn't move and I was deranged.

Statues can't talk.

"Howdy," The statue said again.

I pinched myself several times. I winced as the pain pierced me like needles. Definitely real. My brain was foggy and my lips couldn't form words.

"Hello." The statue said in its rumble of a monotone.

My eyes grew wide and I just sat there, gaping like a fish. With that, the statue stood up. He clicked his polished stone boots, patting his shiny bald patch. My lips formed a word. "Real?!" The statue almost laughed except statues can't laugh or stand up at all.

"I am," The statue smiled.

He saluted me with two stone fingers, leaving his newspaper to flutter to the ground.
"Howdy," It said and wandered off.

Sort of.

Except statues can't move. Right? Or maybe, they can.
