"All metal goes off first," Officer Monty gestures at the trays. "Just take off all access jewelry - whoa there Mr... Pumpkin? Not sure if your head-"

The ground shakes, the thump of enormous pairs of feet slamming the linoleum floor.

"Mr King Kong!" Officer Monty's boots click. "Over here in the line if you please! Oh, your Highness! Didn't see you there!"

Cleopatra peers down her nose at the officer, tossing her dark curtain of shiny hair as her gold arm bangles flash.

"Madam-"

A commotion down the front of the line, a rise in the murmur of excited chatter. The yellow apparition turns, the cheese Ghost, Monty begins to think of it, its see-through form flickering in the fluorescent lights.

A swish of a cape, red boots hovering above Here's the extracted text from the image:

The ground. Well defined muscles through the suit. Monty groans inwardly. Of course it's Superman. What a flashy showboat thinking himself so superior in his blinding cape and spandex shorts.

Monty pulls on a practised smile. "The conveyor belt is that way, sir."

On the other side of the room, the metal detector blares as an empty suit of armour steps through the frame. Lights flash red. Dracula scowls, teeth filed to a point.

Monty sighs and touches the spot above his right eyebrow, the beginnings of a migraine beginning to show. He watches as Sam the friendly pirate drops a hefty chest onto the belt with a clank.

"Please stay in line," He tells Godzilla as the giant dinosaur-thing swings his tail as he tries to dislodge two particularly stubborn hitchhikers.

Batman stands like a shadow, third-last in line, broodingly silently as he stares out the window at the stretch of concrete tarmac and the great parked airplanes.

"Hello."

Monty looks up as Superman smiles charmingly, a flash of perfectly aligned, pearl's white teeth. He smells like the expensive "Super Fresh" expensive cologne he's been endorsing lately on Instagram. The guy has probably never worn braces once in his life.

Monty grits his teeth. "Are you lost, sir?"

"Could you perhaps point me to the men's room?" A conspiratorial wink. Who does this guy think he is, All Might?

Monty points.

Superman thanks him and goes in.

He comes out, sporting normal "civilian clothes" and a pair of wire-rimmed glasses. Who does he think he's fooling.

Another stab of pain from the headache.

Monty needs aspirin. Some coffee would be nice.

Perks of the job.
