# The Multiverse Security Checkpoint

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead as Officer Jenkins adjusted his tie, preparing for another day at the Multiverse Transit Hub. Little did he know, today would be anything but ordinary.

"Next!" Jenkins called out, his voice echoing through the cavernous terminal. A hulking figure approached - Godzilla, clutching a tiny suitcase in his massive claws. The conveyor belt groaned under the weight of his luggage.

"Sir, I'm going to need you to step through the scanner," Jenkins instructed, trying to maintain professionalism. Godzilla let out a low rumble that shook the security cameras. Jenkins glanced at the translation screen: "But I'm radioactive!"

Before Jenkins could respond, a commotion erupted behind him. "Stop that pirate!" shouted Officer Ramirez. Captain Jack Sparrow was attempting to smuggle a chest of cursed Aztec gold through the x-ray machine. The ghostly apparition of Davy Jones materialized, demanding his due.

Meanwhile, in Lane 3, Superman stood patiently as his cape went through the scanner. "I could just fly over," he quipped, flashing his trademark smile. Jenkins rolled his eyes - superheroes were always the most difficult passengers.

The real trouble began when Dracula and the Wolfman reached the checkpoint simultaneously. Their centuries-old feud reignited as they argued over who should go first. Sparks flew as their magical auras clashed, short-circuiting the metal detectors.

"Gentlemen, please!" Jenkins intervened, his voice cracking slightly. "We have a system here. Vampires on odd-numbered days, werewolves on even-numbered days. Today is the 15th."

As the chaos unfolded, Jenkins noticed something peculiar. All these characters, from different universes and timelines, were converging here for a reason. A quick check of the passenger manifest revealed they were all booked on the same flight - Multiverse Airlines Flight 42 to the Nexus Point.

The final straw came when the T-800 Terminator arrived, setting off every alarm in the building. Jenkins sighed, reaching for his special "Multiverse Protocol" manual. Some days, he really missed working at a normal airport.

As the clock struck noon, a portal opened above the security checkpoint. Out stepped Doctor Strange, his cloak billowing dramatically. "Apologies for the delay," he said, snapping his fingers. "We're implementing a new dimensional screening process."

Jenkins slumped into his chair, reaching for his coffee. Just another day at the Multiverse Transit Hub.
