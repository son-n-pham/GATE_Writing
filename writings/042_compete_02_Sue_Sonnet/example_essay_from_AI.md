The Ember Keeper

Professor Zhang's hand trembled as she adjusted her thermal imaging goggles. The readings were impossible – a living creature with an internal temperature of over 800 degrees Celsius. "Like a walking furnace," she whispered, her breath crystallizing in the pre-dawn air like delicate spider webs.

Through the tall grass ahead, something pulsed with an otherworldly orange glow. The dry stalks around it should have ignited instantly, yet they remained untouched, as if nature itself had granted this creature safe passage. Her scientific mind warred with what her eyes were telling her: a frog, no larger than her palm, its skin rippling with living flame.

"The ancient texts weren't myths after all," Professor Zhang murmured, thinking of the weathered scrolls in the university archive that spoke of the Guardian of the Eternal Flame. Her grandmother used to tell stories of special creatures chosen by the elements themselves, but Zhang had dismissed them as mere folktales. Now, crouching in the dew-kissed grass, she felt like a child again, discovering magic was real.

The frog turned its head, fixing her with eyes like molten copper. A sound like crackling embers emerged from its throat, and the morning air grew thick with the scent of warm cinnamon and woodsmoke. The temperature around them rose until the dew evaporated in tiny wisps of steam.

"I won't hurt you," Zhang said softly, reaching into her pack with trembling fingers. She withdrew a small, fireproof container lined with rare earth minerals – prepared for this moment after months of research. The frog watched her movements with ancient wisdom in its gaze.

The grass rustled behind her. "Professor!" her assistant called out. "The development company's trucks are coming! They're starting the land clearing today!"

Time seemed to freeze like a photograph. The frog's flames flickered more intensely, and Zhang understood with sudden clarity. This wasn't just a scientific discovery – this was a guardian of the old world, and its habitat was about to be destroyed.

Making her decision, Zhang set down the container and instead pulled out her phone. "Hello, Environmental Protection Agency? I'm reporting an endangered species sighting that requires immediate habitat protection." She looked at the frog, which had settled back into the grass, its flames dimming to a gentle glow. "Trust me, you're going to want to see this for yourself."

As the sun rose fully, painting the sky in shades of amber and gold, Zhang smiled. Sometimes the best scientific discoveries weren't the ones you captured, but the ones you protected. The frog croaked softly, and for a moment, she could have sworn the sound held approval.
