Black smoke billows up to the sky in great acrid clouds, ballooning across the sun and blotting out the light. Officer Thatchies screams, something into the radio, trying to be heard over the roar of the helicopter.

The extinguishing solution isn't making a dent in the battle against the flames burning red and blinding yellow as it licks the knee-high grasses, dry and brittle, and devours them like a hungry beast.

My fire suit feels too small, too tight, already I can feel the heat of it rolling through my body. Every inch of me is slick with sweet air choking in its warmth.

"DISPATCHING LAND CREW!"

I run as fast as my legs can take me, dousing the fire with extinguishing solutions. It hisses and spotters in protest, rearing back. "Fire heading east!" That can't be right. East is opposite to the wind direction, this can't be possible.

I wouldn't believe it if I weren't seeing it with my own eyes, the steady rush of it moving, setting the straw ablaze.

Something is causing it, I realise. My feet move before I can think, boots crushing the ashen remains of grass.

I spray, gunning for the source as the flames leap and flare up warningly. I think I almost see something, a small, hazy shape in the middle of the inferno... impossible.

And yet, there it is, the tiny silhouette of something as it bounces with the fire.

A sudden, cold, hard jet of water comes devastating in its impact. I aim the hose and spray with everything I have. My arms are shaking with exhaustion, sweat beading running like rivers. I plant my feet and grin my teeth as the water powers on dousing exploding until there is no more.

The hose goes limp in my hands like a dead snake. I breathe in and out with a spluffer. My shoes squelch on mud as I step forward.

A frog blinks up at me, flesh damp and slimy and blackened with soot. It belches, stomach expanding. A sport of smoke from its nose.

The hose drops.

"Mission Accomplished," Officer Thatch's voice buzzes in my ears. "Reel the frog in."

And I do.
