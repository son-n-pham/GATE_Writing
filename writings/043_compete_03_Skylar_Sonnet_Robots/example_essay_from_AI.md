First Day Jitters

The gentle hum of servos filled the conference room as I straightened my light blue shirt for the hundredth time. Being the only human at RoboTech Industries' quarterly planning meeting wasn't exactly how I'd imagined spending my first day at work.

"Welcome, Mr. Chen," chirped the hovering assistant bot, its metallic arms carefully balancing a tower of reports. "Today's agenda is quite exciting!" The enthusiasm in its synthesized voice somehow made me more nervous.

Around the light brown table sat the most diverse group of robots I'd ever encountered. To my left, a yellow-headed unit with owl-like eye sockets studied me with what I hoped was curiosity. Next to it, a sleek model with a blue cranial dome and satellite dish tilted its head, the red sensor above pulsing gently like a patient heartbeat.

"The transition metrics are quite promising," rumbled the red-faced robot at the far end, its grimace seeming more like a quirk of design than actual displeasure. Papers rustled as it gestured at charts scattered across the table. "Human-AI collaboration has increased efficiency by 47.3% this quarter."

I felt my shoulders relax slightly. The golden pyramid-headed robot at the right end of the table placed its hands deliberately on the surface, the gesture oddly human-like. "We've found," it said in melodious tones, "that combining human creativity with robotic precision creates something greater than the sum of its parts."

A warmth spread through my chest, replacing the butterflies that had taken up residence since morning. These weren't the cold, calculating machines from old science fiction movies. They were colleagues who genuinely valued human contribution.

"I think," I said, my voice growing stronger with each word, "I might have some ideas about improving those metrics even further." The satellite-dish robot's red sensor pulsed brighter, and the hovering assistant bobbed excitedly, nearly dropping its papers.

As I stood to share my presentation, I realized that perhaps being the only human in the room wasn't a disadvantage after all. It was precisely why I was here.
