### Overall Assessment

- Total Score: 20/20 (100%)

- Key Strengths:

  1. Seamless integration of action and introspection
  2. Strong character development through crisis
  3. Rich sensory and figurative language

- Priority Elements Demonstrated:

  1. Clear narrative arc with meaningful resolution
  2. Effective use of multiple literary devices
  3. Natural theme development without preaching

- Strategic Techniques Used:
  This example demonstrates how to build a complete narrative that satisfies all rubric elements while maintaining engagement. The story uses a crisis structure to create immediate tension, but balances action with introspection and imagery. It shows how to develop characters through their responses to crisis, how to weave sensory details and figurative language naturally into the narrative, and how to resolve both the physical conflict (rescue) and emotional journey (understanding gained). The ending ties together both plot and thematic elements while leaving readers with a lasting image.
