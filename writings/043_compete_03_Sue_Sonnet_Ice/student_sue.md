The ground is covered in a thick blanket of white snow.

Niya's boots crunch as she walks, dragging her skates along by their laces. Her breaths coalesce into white smoke. Dragon's breath, she likes to call it. The steam of a great dragon.

The cold air bites at her exposed face. She blinks away the frost from her lashes, sticks out a tongue in an attempt to catch any parting flakes.

The sky stretches, endless, a reaching expanse of white blushing down to the palest pink.

Niya reaches the pond's surface, now frozen thickly to flat, clean ice. She isn't the only one who has thought of skating - the makeshift rink is full of skaters, from people wobbling cautiously at the edge near the snow to couples taking flight like Olympic figureskaters, the blades at their feet carving great swirls and crosshatches across the surface like scars.

Niya pulls up the orange hood of her puffer jacket and glides across the ice, her movements natural and practiced.

She sees the shift of shadows beneath of mirrored reflections and things much deeper, where the water has not yet frozen.

She crouches, feeling the coldness seep through her triple-layered pants to her knees.

She imagines objects darting, flitting through the waves cold and unforgiving as Antarctica, a whole month of no light until the ice breaks.

Are there fish there, Niya wonders, alive and swimming through the cool darkness? She wants to know what it is like.

She presses down, nose almost touching the surface.

She sees her reflection, dark and distorted.

She imagines a girl, just like her, standing on the other side of the ice with her orange puffer jacket and boots. A blue sheen to her face.

The fish move silently, ever present.

Niya watches them swim, and counts them one by one in her mind's eye.
