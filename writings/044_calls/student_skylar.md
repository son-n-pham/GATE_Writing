The phone rests in my palm. "Sorry mum," I whisper.
There's a weight in my chest of stone that flattens me.
The screen of my phone blacks alive. The guilt and excitement are raging inside of me.

I had the newest phone. The trendiest thing you could ever get.
But I had abandoned mum.

I looked at my wallpaper. It's Selena, the pop singer everybody's raging about, standing on a stage decked with lights. She's waving her microphone and her dark hair is dancing. I always play her music.

But a locked secret holds me down underwater. A secret so tangled in vine-like chains no one knows. I hate Selena. She soaks up the spotlight like a sponge but doesn't even care to interact with her crowd.

All she is is a magnet that sings loud songs.

It's hard to pretend I like her, but I do it anyway. My finger hovers over my phone. I decide to call mum. She doesn't use phones but I hope she can come round.
"Pip?" Her weary voice cuts like a knife.

"Hi mum," I say awkwardly. "Sorry I didn't pay attention to your traditional recipes." I am about to see mum's eye brows jumping up, but I feel like the stone has been slightly lifted.

"Sorry I only ate microwaveable food from COLES." I feel stupid but I carry on. "Sorry I didn't wear those dresses."

The list drags on. Everytime my chest gets lighter. Mum listens intensively. It feels as though my list is trapped endless. I wish I don't have so many mistakes trapped like cobwebs. But the broom is sweeping them away as I talk. Until Iâ€™m only a little speck against the glow of the setting sun.
