There was a voice in my ear, talking.

It was unfamiliar, someone I had never heard before. All I knew was that it was an unknown number, and probably an advertisement at that I was standing indoors, by the large rectangle window and the red eggyolk of a sun hanging suspended in midday I had things to do. My finger moved to end the call.

"Wait! " The voice on the other end cut in, slightly panicked. My thumb hovered over the red button. For some reason, something about the tone gave me pause.

"What do you want?" I asked.

The voice barelled on. "You know that funny feeling you get when you have a tickle-ites but when you scratch if it's just out of reach, like it's hiding under your skin?”

I stared at the phone, at the name labelled, " Unknown".

"Yes?" I said. "Why?"

"What would you do if you saw a dead bird?"

Well, "I didn't know why I was humouring the voice but I went on regardless. "I would bury it, of course!"
"Right" The other voice said. And it went like this. They talked, I answered. Each return and reply grew more and more elaborate.

I stood for a long time, talking. The words spilt forth from me as if it had been drawn from a hook, the voice was the bait and I was a willing fish.

I shifted my position to get more comfortable I sat on the floor, leaning my back against the hard wall. The carpet was itchy like trimmed dead grass under me. I told the voice and they laughed like I had cracked a great joke, and their laugh was a wonderful thing like the crackling of flames The shadows lengthened on the floor and 1 moved again, leaning against the wall, sitting cross-legged on the ground, moving and shifting.

My tongue ran away from me giddy and thoughtless, as the moon rase and the air grew cooler I went on asked and spoke, anything to make the lovely voice in my ear go on.

I said on the ground, stretched my feet up against the wall, balancing the phone on my chest I listened enraptured by the voice, the rise and fall of the syllables, the beautiful rounded O’s and crisp T's.

I could have stayed like that forever, I reall could. The clouds glided lazily and still I listened.

When I look back, still am unsure about what happened. Had it all been a dream, a figment of my imagination. It should have been uncanny, how Unknown knew so much about me, could hold me there with only a few words perhaps it was a trap, some kind of scam. It never happened again, but sometimes I still wonder every time my phone vibrates.
