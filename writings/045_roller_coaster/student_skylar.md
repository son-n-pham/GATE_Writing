My stomach drops. The butterflies are having a frenzy inside of me. My head is spinning. My legs are jelly. I shut my eyes and my lip quivers. The world is out of reach, far away from my blanket of nausea.

Someone shakes me, I blink. I'm blinded by the adventure park's bright banners and chaotic stalls. "Why were you gurgling?" Pip asks, her freckly face blurrily coming into view. "Huh?" I say groggily.

"Looked like you were hyperventythinging. You were all white and you were sweaty," She says loudly. My face flushes red as a tomato. "Oh, I know why!" Pip giggles. "We're not even on the rollercoaster yet, dummy."

I gulp at the mention of the rollercoaster. My legs go wobbly and numb again. "Tickets please." Pip cackles like a witch and gives the adventure park worker two shimmering gold tickets as she drags me towards a rollercoaster compartment.

As she firmly slams the compartment door closed, I wonder why my best friend is a brash, loud, energetic, and bold girl with bright red hair.

Then I remember.

Pip waves her hands in the air and whoops as the roller coaster shoots like a jet. I scream but not in terror or fear. The butterflies are having a disco party, not a horrorific frenzy. And Pip and I are loving it.
