The sky was lit up like a light bulb. Shooting stars danced across the sky. The grass waved dreamily as the trees swayed.

Lin wandered across the fields, letting the wind ruffle her black hair. Her bare feet pattered like rain on the soft grass as her dark blue dress billowed around her like a cape.

Lin didn't know where she was going, meandering through the open like a lost sheep. She touched the blindfold obscuring her vision, remembering how she had been tangled in the thick jungle a long time ago.

Something squelched between Lin's toes—mud. She waded further into the muddy pond, letting the refreshing water wash her thighs. Something brushed her ankle—something cold and slippery. Mam had told her these were fish: silver, frolicking animals that playfully swim in ponds.

Lin wished she could see them as they encircled her in an intriguing dance, splashing her pale face. She could hear loud thumps behind her. "Mam?" Lin whispered. Mam laughed and scooped Lin up in a tight hug. Mam's red blindfold brushed against Lin's pink cheeks as she pulled her out of the water.

"Da said there would be shooting stars tonight," Lin said.

Mam nodded. "I wish we could see them," she sighed, settling down on the gracefully swaying grass, letting the whispering wind brush her hair aside.

Lin smiled weakly. "I wish I could see again," she murmured wistfully. Mam laughed—a sound that was hard to distinguish between sweetness and bitterness.

"Well," she said softly, "you can't escape from the present, can you?"

Lin nodded. For a moment, the only sound was the whistling of the wind. Then Mam added gently, "But you can always wish upon a star."
