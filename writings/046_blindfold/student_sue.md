The air was cold - not bitingly so, but the sort of cold that crept down under your skin and stayed, the sort you would hardly notice except for the fact that the temperature would never feel quite right.

I could feel my skin tingling in response, the slight rise of goosebumps no doubt pock-marking my skin.

The dress was insufficiently thin, hanging off my skin like a sleeping gown, the fabric itching against me, a touch too rough.

Grass crackled underfoot, the scratchy, dry dead sort that clearly hadn't been watered in a while. It chafed against my bare feet like kindling for a fire.

The whistle of the wind sounded, rustling the far-off leaves, giving bend to the trees. I imagined seeing them sway, their great bows bowing in compliance.

"It's strange," I said allowed, and my voice seemed to come out too loud, too unbidden I was suddenly reluctant to break the peace. "Strange to not see anything."

"Is it?" Her voice came somewhere off the left of me, a medium, mellow kind of voice. "I find it rather refreshing to allow my mind to see."

I pondered these words. Allow my mind to see? I tilted my head up to what I assumed to be the sky, feeling the breeze wash over my face. I was vaguely aware of the blindfold, pulled tight, a stretch of warmth over my eyes. I breathed the night in.

"Look," she said.

"Look where?" I asked.

"Up." And I imagined her pointing, stretching her long, pale index finger up to the sky. I looked up.

"There are clouds, see?" She said. "Sailing, drifting like boats. The sky is the ocean."

It's not, I thought, but didn't say. "Really?"

"Do you see the stars?" She pointed again, and I could hear the smile in her voice. "There are so many! And look, a shooting star right there!"

I looked, and in my mind's eye, I saw it; a streak of silver and gold falling through the space like a dying sparkler.

I played along. "The full moon is bright tonight."

"There's a cloud in the shape of a cat!"

More sights followed, each more outrageous than the next. A castle in the sky, a giant, a dragon. The stories grew.

Things came to an end, eventually. The footsteps came, the rags drawn off our eyes. We were there again, barefeet in the dead fields by the farmyard.

But it was nice to pretend, just for a moment.
