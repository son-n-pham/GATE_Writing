The mountain's reflection shivers in the lake as three shadows stretch across its mirror surface. My sister Maya leads our trio, her ponytail swinging like a pendulum with each determined step. Behind her, Aunt Sarah's hiking stick taps a steady rhythm against the rocky shore, while I bring up the rear, trying to capture every detail of this moment in my mind.

"Look!" Maya points to where delicate blue flowers dance in the breeze. "Alpine forget-me-nots. Mom's favorite." Her voice catches slightly on the word 'favorite', and I know we're all thinking the same thing. This was meant to be a party of four.

The morning sun bathes the snowcapped peaks in golden light, transforming them into ancient crowns adorning the horizon. Our reflections ripple and merge as we wade through the shallows, the cool water numbing our tired feet. The scent of pine and wild herbs mingles with the crisp mountain air, carrying whispers of adventures yet to come.

"Your mother," Aunt Sarah breaks the contemplative silence, "climbed that peak when she was exactly your age, Maya." She gestures toward the tallest mountain, its snow-dusted summit piercing the clouds like a silver arrow. "Said it was the moment she knew she'd be a mountaineer."

Maya's shoulders stiffen. "I know what you're thinking, Aunt Sarah, but I'm not ready. Not yet."

"Nobody's pushing you," I chime in, watching a family of ducks glide across our path, their wake creating expanding circles that distort our reflections. "Mom would want us to find our own paths."

The wind picks up, sending ripples across the lake's surface, fragmenting our mirror images into thousands of glittering pieces. Like memories, I think, each one perfect and incomplete at the same time.

Maya stops suddenly, her backpack shifting like a startled turtle. "Did you see that?" She points to where the lake meets the mountain's shadow. A flash of silver breaks the surface â€“ a fish jumping, perhaps, or just the light playing tricks.

"Look at our reflections," Aunt Sarah says softly. "Three generations of strong women, carrying on. Your mother is still with us, in every step we take."

I watch our reflected selves, walking in perfect synchronization with our real bodies. Above, an eagle soars across the pristine blue sky, its reflection skating across the water like a phantom. Maya reaches back and squeezes my hand, then Aunt Sarah's.

"Maybe," Maya says, her voice stronger now, "we could try that summit next summer. As a family."

The lake sparkles like scattered diamonds as we continue our journey, three women and their reflections, moving forward together. In the water below, our mirror selves seem to smile, knowing that sometimes the strongest paths are the ones we forge together, one step at a time.
