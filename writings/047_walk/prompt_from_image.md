# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "The image depicts three stylized figures, likely women, hiking across a landscape reflected in a body of water. The figures are drawn in a simple, illustrative style with dark outlines and solid colors. They are shown from the side, walking from left to right, each with a backpack and hiking stick. The first figure has dark hair in a ponytail, wearing a grey top and black shorts, and carrying a blue pack with a yellow roll. The second is similar, with dark hair pulled back, a grey top and white shorts, a teal pack with a white roll. The third has shorter dark hair under a red hat, with a grey top and white shorts, and carries a dark pack with a yellow roll. Below the hikers is a mirrored reflection in the water. The background is divided into zones, with green grass, a darker green line of trees and then a mountain landscape, partially covered in snow. In the foreground, there are green plants with tall blue flowers.  The sky above the horizon is a light pale yellow.",
