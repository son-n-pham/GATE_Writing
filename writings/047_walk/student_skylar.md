We are wading through the cool lake. The mud squelches through our toes and the morning sun is already baking us like turkeys in an oven.

Strange, exotic plants reach down, beckoning us to eat. But we keep on walking, feeling the wet fish slip in and out of our legs.

I gaze up at the towering mountain. It is so covered by soft white snow that it's like an ancient ice giant. A thick tangle of trees shroud the base like a low hanging mist. I close my eyes and relax.

The wind dances through my hair. The mud tickles my toes.

We wade further into the lake until we are up to our waists in cold water. Then, there is a flash of grey.

I bury my nose deeper into the book, feeling the ominous words form into pictures.

Something lurks under the water. A vast black shape just in front of us the words form into a gruesomely detailed picture. The book trembles in my hands.

A beast looms before me. Its scales are a swampy green and its eyes are merely coal black slits swimming in a sparkling yellow oasis. Mammoth teeth, each the size of castle turrets, drip with venom that sizzles and pops.

My knees turn to jelly and fear blooms like a deadly flower. My heart beats like a bass drum.

I can't move. The mud roots me in place like a weed, a weed standing face to face with a gardener. My breathing quickens and my mind races.

The beast bellows in anger. It advances, venomous fangs bared like a wolf.

"Dinner!" The voice is distant but I vaguely hear it.

The world freezes. I shut the book and smile. "Coming!" I call.

Books are truly magical. I think as I wander out towards the kitchen.
