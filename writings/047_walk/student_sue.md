The water ripples as I wade, thigh-deep through the marsh. Its surface is strangely reflective like glass, rebounding into vibrating eddies.

My hiking boots squelch on the mud beneath and I lift them with a wet sucking sound, stepping instead onto the rocks where my Feet won't get stuck.

"Careful of the mud here," I call back down the line, testing the space in front of me with my makeshift branch/ walking stick. "Don't get caught in it!"

A few non-commital murmurs of acknowledgement behind me.

Sweat drips on my forehead and I swipe the strands of limp hair hanging in my eyes, trying to gouge our position on the sun. It really shouldn't be so stifling today but the humidity clings tight under our skin. The warm water we are sloshing through provides no respite.

"Nearly there!" I call back, which is a lie. We're only past halfway. I pause to look behind me see how the others.

Exhausted, I can tell, but pushing on stubbornly, pride egging them on to keep up with the guide. Later, they will collapse onto their soft hotel beds half-dead and claiming to never walk another day in their life. I will have to repeat the trek, again and again.

I signal for a water break and they stop, red-faced and panting. Half of them are already snapping photos. The scenery must have been magnificent once upon a time before the ice-capped mountains had worn away and half the forest eroded.

I gulp down a bottle of cold water, pausing to tell one of the ladies to stop bothering the frogs.

There is a craggy hill of rock left where Mt. Pelion had once been and I point it out as tourists fawn over it. I can still imagine it, great towering bergs of snow.

A weak breeze ruffles by, sending the blue-cap flowers quivering as if from the cold. There used to be thousands of those I think, but now they cluster in small bunches by the streams.

It's a bit of a shame, really, what time has done to this place.
