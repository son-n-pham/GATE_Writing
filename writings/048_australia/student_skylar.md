The river is cool and the sand sifts under my bare feet. Several jellyfish bob about the smooth blue water.
The foreshore is crowded - from people to bright food trucks to dogs. The wind dances through the crisp air as the sun bathes the city. All of the banners and billboards advertise the same thing:
The Australia Day hot air balloon.

I frolic like a dog through the refreshing water, letting the scent of crepes and food truck fries wash over me. Several boats whiz by.
I wave my glow sticks at them and hop around. "Look!" someone cries. Everyone gasps. I squint up into the sky. I can't see anything, just the soft orange strokes that paint the sky.

I run around in circles and squint. "It's the balloon!" someone yells. I jump up as high as I can. A little red and blue speck catches my eye and I whoop.
There is a thud and a crunch.

I land awkwardly on my knees. A sharp seashell digs into my shin. I wail like an injured wolf as I blindly stumble out of the water and feel the thin stream of blood trickle down my leg.
Dad runs over and tries to console me while stopping the flow of blood with a tissue. "I didn't get to see the balloon," I whisper, tears trickling down my cheeks as he gently holds my hand.

"Shhh." he whispers. "The fireworks are starting."

I open my eyes and rub my nose.
Just as the enchanting boom of a firework rings across the city, I smile and giggle.
