The river is cool and the sand sifts under my bare feet. Several jellyfish bob about the smooth blue water.

The foreshore is crowded - from people, to bright food trucks to playful dogs. The wind dances through the crisp air as the sun bathes the city. All of the banners and billboards boast the same thing:

The Australia Day hot air balloon.



I frolic like a dog through the refreshing water, letting the scent of crepes and food truck fries wash over me. Several boats whiz by like jets.

I wave my glow sticks at them and hop around like a rabbit. "Look!" someone cries. Everyone gasps. I squint up into the sky. I can't see anything, just the soft orange strokes that paint the sky.



I run around in circles and squint. "It's the balloon!" someone yells. I jump up as high as I can. A little red and blue speck catches my eye and I whoop. I wave my arms like crazy, but before i know it, I’m falling from my jump fast.



There is a thud and a crunch.



I land awkwardly on my knees. A sharp seashell digs into my shin. I wail like an injured wolf as I blindly stumble out of the water and feel the thin stream of blood trickle down my leg. All I can think is that it hurts. I’m numb and my brain can’t function. The cut feels like it’s bubbling and boiling. I sob and drag my leg across the grass, but it’s like a sack of bricks.



Dad runs over and tries to console me while stopping the flow of blood with a tissue. "I didn't get to see the balloon," I whisper, tears trickling down my cheeks as he gently holds my hand.



"Shhh." he whispers, placing a finger over my pouting lips. "The fireworks are starting."



I open my eyes and rub my snotty nose, giving a little sneeze.



And just as the enchanting boom of a firework rings across the city, I smile and giggle. I clap wave as the sparks rain down.
