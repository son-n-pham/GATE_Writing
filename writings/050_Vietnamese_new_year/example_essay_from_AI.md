The Last Red Envelope

The neon signs painted the puddles in electric rainbow hues as I hurried through Ho Chi Minh City's bustling streets. My laptop bag bounced against my hip, heavy with the presentation I'd spent weeks preparing. "Foreign businesses and Tet celebrations - a guide to success." The irony wasn't lost on me; here I was, supposed to be the expert, yet my own heart raced with uncertainty.

Thunder rumbled overhead like distant firecrackers, and the scent of approaching rain mingled with the aromatic steam rising from nearby phá»Ÿ stalls. The old Vietnamese woman at the corner caught my eye, her wrinkled face creasing into a knowing smile as she arranged red envelopes on her wooden cart. Each one sparkled like a ruby against the grey sky, promising luck and prosperity for the coming year.

"You're late, Ms. Chen," Mr. Nguyen's voice crackled through my phone, sharp as breaking fortune cookies. "Our investors are waiting."

My stomach twisted like a dragon dancing through the night sky. "Five minutes, sir. The traffic is like a river overflowing its banks." I dodged a wave of motorbikes that flowed around me like schools of metallic fish, their horns creating a symphony of impatience.

The Lotus Tower loomed ahead, its glass walls reflecting the storm clouds gathering above like dark silk. In the lobby, a massive digital display counted down the days until Tet, each number pulsing like a heartbeat. Fourteen days. Two weeks to convince these investors that our company understood their culture well enough to expand into Vietnam.

The elevator felt like a cage of butterflies, my presentation cards fluttering in my trembling hands. That's when I noticed it - a red envelope, somehow slipped into my bag. The old woman? Inside, instead of money, I found a note: "Success comes to those who bridge worlds with respect."

I stepped into the conference room, where stern faces turned toward me like moons in a business-suit sky. But now, something had changed. The weight of the red envelope in my pocket felt like an anchor of understanding.

"Before I begin," I said, placing the red envelope on the table, "I'd like to acknowledge that true business success here isn't just about profits and preparations. It's about understanding the heart of Tet - family, respect, and new beginnings."

The tension in the room dissolved like morning mist under the sun. Mr. Nguyen's eyes softened, and someone smiled. Outside, the first drops of rain began to fall, but through the windows, I could already see the festival fireworks being set up along the river, ready to paint tomorrow's sky with dreams of prosperity.
