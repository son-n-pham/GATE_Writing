"Stupid idea," Joe muttered, rolling his eyes. I felt hurt, like my dreams had been stabbed with a jagged dagger. Joe groaned and walked over to the whiteboard. I had spent an hour creating a detailed step-by-step process and explanation of my new website, and Joe was just rubbing them off as if he was scraping gum off the bottom of his polished shoes.

Then, he pulled the picture of the Vietnamese New Year fireworks and threw it into the waste paper basket.

My insides crumbled like a deteriorating moss-covered stone wall.

"First reason why it's a horrific idea," Joe announced in a flat, expressionless monotone. "No one wants to read about how foreign businesses can prepare for the Vietnamese New Year."

He droned on, dragging me along with him in his mundane world of endless sand. Now, I was rolling my eyes, and the next second I was running home, my dreams—a once magnificent mansion—now a pile of rubble Joe had stepped on and stamped over and over again.

I sat on the edge of my bed typing furiously. A long line of reasons why I hate Joe. I clicked send, and Joe was back, tormenting me like a ghost.

I slapped my keyboard in frustration.

And then a file opened.

It had opened on the first website I had ever made, I had been a flop, and all the reviews were only criticizing my design skills.

But when I looked at it again, there was one five-star review. Five glistening stars above a short paragraph.

"Great tips! Really helpful. I wish you could make a story about how foreign businesses can prepare for the Vietnamese New Year. Thanks a heap."

I gazed at it and my eyes bulged, I gripped the side of my chair. My hands were trembling. And moving the rubble, something stirred.
