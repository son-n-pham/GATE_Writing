“There's the Vietnamese New Year coming up next month.” Mr Li adjusts his wire-rimmed glasses and taps the date on the computer screen. "We'd expect to have a fresh influx of orders any day now. Already have a handful of orders trickling in from Ho Chi Minh City."

"Yessir. " I follow his gaze as his eyes travel to the demographics chart on the board.

“You’re off to Vietnam, then.”

I stand there for a moment, gaping "Sir?"

"You're going there,"He speaks slowly, as if talking to a child. "To set up the fireworks.”

Now I stand by the edge of the river by the city, the murky grey water lapping at the beach, crusted over with plastic. The air smells of car exhaust and traffic; all I hear is the constant honk of motorbikes protesting against the ongoing traffic.

The late afternoon sun filters pale and weak through the blanket of clouds stretched white across the sky.

The metal firework pistons are heavy under my arms. I lift them, straining against the weight.

Business preparation. Sure. Resentment broils inside me like wallowing soup but I try to tamp it down.

I unload the parts, one by one from the back of the dented old rental truck. The driver's no help, he stands on the side of the road kicking trash along the gutters and sucking on his long pipe that rather resembles a didgeridoo.

Lunch is banh mi, hastily snatched from a dilapidated neighbouring shop. The sauce is good but it tastes ... strange.

I'm covered in sweat by nightfall and the cool air provides some respite. As the fireworks explode into shifting flashes of bright red and blue against the sky, I sit back to watch my handiwork.

I feel a strange sense of satisfaction, watching them go after today's work. A sense of accomplishment.

The truck driver says something in Vietnamese and gestures vaguely at the sky. He gives me a thumbs up.

I give him one in return.
