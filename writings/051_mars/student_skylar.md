Pip peeked out of the circular window. She gasped, The rocket had finally landed, she was standing on the red planet. Her eyes grew as wide as saucers and her jaw dropped like a gaping fish.

The last few specks of dust which had been shifted by the landing were dancing through the air and slowly disappearing. A vast never ending blanket of rocky red stretched out before her rising in jagged peaks and dipping in steep valleys.

Back on Earth the lab shook. It trembled like there was an earthquake. But there wasn't. Clapping filled the air and a some people wooped and danced. There was a raging party in the lab. Nobody could believe that the rocket had landed.

And nobody could believe that Pip was putting on her suit and carefully exiting the rocket, and stepping out on to the red soil of Mars.

Pip felt like she was floating in a dream. Pip stepped forward and shielded herself from the flying dust with two arms. She carefully dug something out of her pocket and pulled out a flag. It waved happily as shell planted it firmly in the soil.

And there, on the red planet, the Australian flag stood firm and tall, battling against the cruel wind and extreme temperature.

And from the base of the flag, something moved, It was a plant. It wrapped around the flag. What was it? A new beginning? Pip didn't know. She smiled. Despite the heat filtering through the thick suit, Pip felt a sense of accomplishment. Like she had just climbed Mount Everest.

She knew deep in her heart that she could be the first human on mars, but she wasn't the last. Pip looked at the small flower one last time then climbed backinside the rocket.
