The sky stretches, an endless blanket of dusty orange that settles, thick and choking.

Hills and mountains emerge from the gloom, craggy red outcroppings of rock that breaks move the flat land.

Smoke billows from a crack in the canyon, coiling up to the sky in lazy loops of blackened fog and falling ash.

The debris is scattered about - a metal plating here, shattered remnants of aluminium and a smouldering rocket booster.

The dented side door of the broken ship creaks.

A pair of gloved fingers appears on the edge, easing the catch open with a pitiful groan-

The great dusty orange sky is reflected in the helmet's shiny globe surface, impenetrable.

The suit creaks as the martian moves, a white shape against the dark red of mars.

Days drift dragging on slowly like clockwork.

The martian moves, shifting rocks, moving a barricade into the landscape. It doesn't talk, or eat, only moves like a silent ghost hard at work.

Precarious green shoots emerge from the cracks.

The martian observes them noiselessly, petals reflected in the helmet's mirror surface. It tries to touch the flower; the stem breaks under the pressure of its fingertips.

Another moment, the martian emerges from its hermitshell of a home to discover a cicada.

It is fat, dark, the size of the Martian's gloved thumb.

The martian watches it buzz, tiny iridescent wings flitting as it moves.

I apologize for the previous formatting. Here's a clean, narrative-style transcription of the text:

About among the crawling vines, at night, it curls up among the leaves and sleeps. The martian watches it come and go, a fascinating dance.

The sunlight never quite breaches the cloud of dust that constantly hangs low and yet - one day there is two cicadas, the next eleven. The martian counts them as it waters the weeds for the day.

The vines grow and spread, covering the ship. The martian works.
