"What's going on?" All the cars in front of us had stopped. Dad shrugged. I groaned and gazed glumly at the landscape around me - angry cars honking like geese, tall trees swaying in the wind, bright banners waving merrily at us.

I hummed and fidgeted as I gazed up at the sky, which was a canvas of pale blue strokes dotted here and there with scudding white clouds. The minutes felt like long mundane hours. Time was dragging me like a sack in the bare desert, moving ever slower as the clock ticked. "I'm so bored," I moaned, flopping back in my chair.

Dad looked over at me, his eyes directly boring into mine, two glittering blue pools of kindness. "Imagine," he whispered. I rolled my eyes. How grand could imagination get? I went back to aimlessly staring at the sky.

Something dark was moving across the sky. I squinted up, the sky still soft blue but something moving over our car. A dark and ominous shadow gliding over the city.

My eyes grew wide as saucers, and I pressed my nose to the glass. I felt like a small child at a zoo, but the shadow that passed over our car was more than a lion. It boasted vast wings of the deepest blue and mighty claws that tipped its big skeletal feet. "Dad!" I shrieked.

Dad seemed to be nodding off, and drool was already beginning to run down the corner of his mouth.

Dad awoke, and his head immediately perked up. "There's some sort of flying creature!" I cried, shaking Dad. Dad looked out of his window. He looked puzzled. I looked out of my window. All I could see was the bright blue sky. My eyes grew wide again. "Where?" I gaped at the sky.

I was sure I had seen the shadow, the wings - imagination. Dad's voice rang in my ears. Maybe I was experiencing imagination in its grandest form. Just as I thought that, the traffic light turned green and the car started to move again.
