Traffic has slowed to an insufferable crawl. There is just the highway, choked to bursting with cars lined back to back down The roads. The sounds of cars honking, protesting against the congestion fills the air the dreaded symphony of a long haul.

Marla groans in the driver's seat head dropping onto the steering wheel with a heavy thump. "This is useless."

"Everything is temporary," I offer consolingly but even as I say this my patience is stretching thin.

"You can't stand it, can you?" Her voice is muffled, hair falling around her head like a shroud. "I hate traffic."

"No need to use the 'H' word."

"I hate the world."

"There must be a reasonable explanation," I try to say, quite reasonably. "Things will move along..." Something catches my eye.

The sky is blue today, the kind of white blank blue that stretches, bright as cerulean. Not a single dash of clouds; the sun beats relentlessly down on the roads. But that is quite normal.

What surprises me is the dark blot on the horizon, growing steadily larger.

It was quite small at first - small enough to dismiss as a bird, or perhaps an odd hot-air balloon or a biplane. But it is neither.

"Maria?" My voice is uncharacteristically high. "Do you see that?"

"What?" Marla tips her head sideways and cracks an eye open to glare at me like a petulant cat. She glances over my shoulder. "That's a biplane."

"No, it's not." I unlock the side door and step out onto the gravel road. Maria huffs something about overactive imagination and follows, dragging her heels.

The shape has grown. It is no longer just a blob but a large thing, with knobbly tendrils hanging and protruding from the base like roots.

Wait. Roots?

A shadow falls across the highway, huge and dark, blotting out the sunlight.

Maria gasps, a clatter sounding as she drops her phone.

It looks almost like a truly gigantic crust of earth had been drawn out from the ground.

Dirt falls off in clumps, hitting the windshield and bouncing. Surely this can't be real.

I see it before me; the great floating island encrusted with trees routed deep in, so impossibly large. I gawked - what else was there to do?

On the highway, it was as if every car had fallen silent.

Everyone watches as it glides, slow and steady across the sky like a great blue whale trailing leaves down onto vs.

I think I make it out, the great winding rivers and waterfalls, boughs stretching up to the sky, drinking in the light.

An island in the sky.
