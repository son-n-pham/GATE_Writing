The sieve rested in my pale hands. The nervousness flew like butterflies in my stomach. "Sue?" Someone said. I nodded and took a deep breath. I'm ready. I thought as I marched out of the room, my head held high. I strode through a corridor dimly lit by small lights that appeared to be dancing around me like fireflies.

Then, I exhaled and walked into the golden light of the stage, sieve in hand. Sharks barnet said in a slightly wobbly but loud voice. They didn't say anything, they just sat on their sharks chairs and jotted down notes. "Do you pay attention to the amount of salt in everyday foods? Do you think you are consuming too much?"

A shark mused thoughtfully and I beamed. "My name is Sue and I'm going to tell you why you should invest into FILTER, a new sieve designed to reduce the amount of salt we consume!"

All the words rushed back like a tidal wave.

It felt like I was babbling in gibberish, but the sharks were nodding, impressed.

The questions came. I answered immediately, until my words were almost tumbling over themselves to escape my mouth. "How many sales have you made?" It felt like soap was frothing out of my mouth. I couldn't control the flow of sentences. "Zero."

The shark raised his eyebrow and my cheeks flushed a deep red. I had said the WRONG thing. I had spent months memorizing and learning information on websites, newspapers, anything I could get my hands on.

And it had ended with one wrong word. I dreaded the ‘no’ that would come from the shark. "And you would like...?"

I swallowed, "Fifty grand."

The sharks discussed. The sharks smiled. "Yes."
