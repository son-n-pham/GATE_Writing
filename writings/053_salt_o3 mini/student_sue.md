"Read this," I slap my laptop down onto the writing desk in front of Grandpa with a heavy thump. He jumps at the sudden noise, legs creaking, and stares at the glowing screen.

"Eh?"

"You should read this," I nudge the laptop closer and he squints at the keyboard skeptically, chip halfway to his mouth.

"Why?" It crunches as he swallows, spraying crumbs and spittle.

"Too much sodium" bad for you, "I try to speak reasonably, patiently.

"No it's not" Another crisp is shoved into the gaping hole.

I pinch the bridge of my nose, pointing the lines out clearly. "It says, Most people in the United States consume far more sodium than federal health officials recommend."

"But we don't live in America," Grandpa scratches the tuft of white hair clinging desperately to his bald, liver-spotted scalp and his hand disappears into the hip bag once more.

"Two thousand three hundred milligrams!" I stab the words with my finger. "Exceeding that increases your risk of high blood pressure and-"

Grandpa throws a chip at me and eases slowly out of his moth-eaten armchair, knobbly limbs crackling.

"And where are you going?" I demand.

Grandpa retrieves his walking stick, pouring the last of the chip crumbs down his throat. "Gard'ning"

This really needs to be taken seriously, I splutter, waving the laptop in the air.

Grandpa makes a swatting motion over his shoulder as if to swat a fly. "I'm eighty and my blood pressure's just fine." He steps out the back door, humming something off-key and mumbling about "young people and their new-fangled ideas"

Outside the sun has burned to a brilliant shine, saturating the plants in green and casting stark shadows.

"Grandpa," I groan. The old man hops expertly across a patch of weeds and shakes his bony fist of the sky "I will eat what want!" He dances over the petunias, cackling.
