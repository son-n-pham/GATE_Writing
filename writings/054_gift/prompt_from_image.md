The box's interior is dark blue with sparkly, yellow-gold star-like shapes scattered inside. The exterior of the box and lid is white and decorated with subtle patterns. A ribbon tied in a bow is visible on the lid. The background is a plain, pale blue texture that resembles a tablecloth or paper. The text \"The Gift\" appears centered at the top of the image in a simple, black sans-serif font.
