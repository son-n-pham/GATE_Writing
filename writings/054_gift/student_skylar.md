The Gift

There it was. A petite box in the corner of my room wrapped in ribbon. It could've been a dream. There was a gift. Just for me. I slipped out of bed and peered through the curtain. It was still dark, and the sky was a canvas of dark strokes dotted with twinkling stars.

I gently pulled back the curtains and let the silver moonlight bathe my room. Then, I cautiously scurried over to the gift and picked it up.

It was heavy. I gasped loudly as the weight yanked me down. It felt like I was holding the world inside of the little present. I heaved it over to my bed and slowly placed it on the bed. "Should I open it?" I whispered. I sat next the gift and traced the edges with a pale and trembling finger.

I gazed around my bleak room. I wondered what colour the walls were. I signed and looked out to the moon, wondering if the moon was actually yellow.

I could only see the silver moonlight bathing me in soft hues of grey.

My eyes flitted back to the gift.

The gift that sat next to me, waiting patiently for me to open it. My fingers fumbled to open it. It was made of a smooth thin, yet strangely strong material. I finally managed to hook my fingers under the lid and pried it open.

I didn't know what to expect.

I saw something glint. It was glinting like I had never saw anything glint. It sparkled and danced before my eyes. I blinked. My breathing quickened like an accelerating car.

Colour.

Sparks flying from the gift.

Bursting with colour.
