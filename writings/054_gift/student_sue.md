The box arrived at her doorstep the next very day since Pip had pressed the "add to cart button", then subsequently removed it in a sudden bout of doubt of course then she hadn't really expected another delivery after this. It was supposed to be a quiet day of reading on the couch, flipping idly through her copy of The Metamorphosis without really reading it as Calchas curled up in the rectangle of sunlight pouring through the window, sharpening his claws and preening himself like the particularly self-absorbed feline he was.

Pip nudged the small, wrapped parcel squatting innocently on her welcome mat with a foot. It felt fairly light. A present from her brother? But no, it wasn't her birthday or christmas or any particular gift-giving day.

She picked the box up gingerly. It was light, a square in her hands. Cardboard. Was it an empty box?

Pip turned it over in her hands, to check if it perhaps had some sort of note attached to the sender Perhaps the mailman had sent it to the wrong house. That happened a lot.

There was nothing there only the white cardboard box and the ribbon tied so carefully around for decoration.

Is it for me then? Pip wondered. She moved across the cluttered kitchen to her desk where unable to contain her curiosity she pulled the ribbon free unknotting quickly to her fingers which worked strangely adept despite her failings in crochet.

From the window. Calchas watched tale flicking in vague interest.

Pip opened the box.

And there it was the entirety of its content Absolutely nothing.

There was only the flat bottom of the box and the square sides, all white. Nothing in between.

Pip could not quell the disappointed that surged, unwarranted.

She stuck her finger into the box; nothing happened, of course. She was quite about to leave the box right there, resume her listless reading when a movement caught her eye.

A glint. A sparkle of gold, eddying upwards from the box in a swirl of gold dust.

Pip's eyes fixed upon this spectacle, transfixed as the particles danced, catching the light. The room suddenly looked less dull, the sky less pale.

A sort of shift occurred, one she could not put a finger to. Calchas suddenly sat up, ears pricked, sensing the change.

Pip watched the stars twinkle, two twirling. Up, up until they touched the ceiling and painted the world in gold.
