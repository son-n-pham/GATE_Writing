It was only a photo, really. A post. I'd taken it on one of the better days, when the sun was a blinding ball of white in the sky and the clouds were sparse. I hadn't realised it would be so controversial at the time- I pressed the button and it was up.

I went home cooked up a simple dinner (mac and cheese, a lazy classic), donned my pyjamas and went to bed.

It was the next day when I woke to an incessant buzzing on my phone. It lay beside my pillow, vibrating like a trembling thing. The screen would not go dark.

I rolled over and slapped at it, flailing around on the mattress like a wet dog till at last it went blessedly silent.

The peace lasted seconds before it started again.

This time the phone would not turn off no matter how much I swatted it.

"Stupid phone" I grumbled voice muffled with sleep. I turned it on.

The sudden onslaught of messages overwhelmed me; I could see rows and rows and rows upon comments, notifications all pouring in like an overbearing stream. What on earth?

I snatched the phone up to check them.

They were all on the same topic, the same photo, the same posted I had added the afternoon before. It had been nothing then, a force of habit, I had responded, as anyone should. I hadn't noticed anything off.

Now, the crawling rivers of remarks slammed against me like a tidal wave pinning me down to the bed frame, unable to move.

They were unending, relentless scathing comments: lashing down like a storm, cutting me open and spilling every fault. The texts flooded forth burying me under a mountain of doubt.

Did I do something wrong? Why is this happening to me? Am I at fault?

The texts were like dead weight, crushing in its pressure, leaving me wheezing for breath. My eyes moved in a blur as my thumb swiped mechanically, scrolling, always scrolling it was a pattern that would never end.

I didn't know how long I stayed there in bed, unmoving like a hermit locked away from the world.

It was just me and the words and the long, constant criticisms. Go away! I wanted to call back. What did I ever do?

I was fenced in, drowning.

It was a long time before I finally dragged myself out of the bed, undrew the curtains to let the sunlight pour in.

I deleted the app, after I felt some loss but did not return.

The box arrived at her doorstep the next very day since Pip had pressed the "add to cart button", then subsequently removed it in a sudden bout of doubt of course then she hadn't really expected another delivery after this. It was supposed to be a quiet day of reading on the couch, flipping idly through her copy of The Metamorphosis without really reading it as Calchas curled up in the rectangle of sunlight pouring through the window, sharpening his claws and preening himself like the particularly self-absorbed feline he was.

Pip nudged the small, wrapped parcel squatting innocently on her welcome mat with a foot. It felt fairly light. A present from her brother? But no, it wasn't her birthday or christmas or any particular gift-giving day.

She picked the box up gingerly. It was light, a square in her hands. Cardboard. Was it an empty box?

Pip turned it over in her hands, to check if it perhaps had some sort of note attached to the sender Perhaps the mailman had sent it to the wrong house. That happened a lot.

There was nothing there only the white cardboard box and the ribbon tied so carefully around for decoration.

Is it for me then? Pip wondered. She moved across the cluttered kitchen to her desk where unable to contain her curiosity she pulled the ribbon free unknotting quickly to her fingers which worked strangely adept despite her failings in crochet.

From the window. Calchas watched tale flicking in vague interest.

Pip opened the box.

And there it was the entirety of its content Absolutely nothing.

There was only the flat bottom of the box and the square sides, all white. Nothing in between.

Pip could not quell the disappointed that surged, unwarranted.

She stuck her finger into the box; nothing happened, of course. She was quite about to leave the box right there, resume her listless reading when a movement caught her eye.

A glint. A sparkle of gold, eddying upwards from the box in a swirl of gold dust.

Pip's eyes fixed upon this spectacle, transfixed as the particles danced, catching the light. The room suddenly looked less dull, the sky less pale.

A sort of shift occurred, one she could not put a finger to. Calchas suddenly sat up, ears pricked, sensing the change.

Pip watched the stars twinkle, two twirling. Up, up until they touched the ceiling and painted the world in gold.
