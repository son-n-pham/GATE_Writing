It was only a photo, really. A post. I'd taken it on one of the better days, when the sun was a blinding ball of white in the sky and the clouds were sparse. I hadn't realised it would be so controversial at the time- I pressed the button and it was up.

I went home cooked up a simple dinner (mac and cheese, a lazy classic), donned my pyjamas and went to bed.

It was the next day when I woke to an incessant buzzing on my phone. It lay beside my pillow, vibrating like a trembling thing. The screen would not go dark.

I rolled over and slapped at it, flailing around on the mattress like a wet dog till at last it went blessedly silent.

The peace lasted seconds before it started again.

This time the phone would not turn off no matter how much I swatted it.

"Stupid phone" I grumbled voice muffled with sleep. I turned it on.

The sudden onslaught of messages overwhelmed me; I could see rows and rows and rows upon comments, notifications all pouring in like an overbearing stream. What on earth?

I snatched the phone up to check them.

They were all on the same topic, the same photo, the same posted I had added the afternoon before. It had been nothing then, a force of habit, I had responded, as anyone should. I hadn't noticed anything off.

Now, the crawling rivers of remarks slammed against me like a tidal wave pinning me down to the bed frame, unable to move.

They were unending, relentless scathing comments: lashing down like a storm, cutting me open and spilling every fault. The texts flooded forth burying me under a mountain of doubt.

Did I do something wrong? Why is this happening to me? Am I at fault?

The texts were like dead weight, crushing in its pressure, leaving me wheezing for breath. My eyes moved in a blur as my thumb swiped mechanically, scrolling, always scrolling it was a pattern that would never end.

I didn't know how long I stayed there in bed, unmoving like a hermit locked away from the world.

It was just me and the words and the long, constant criticisms. Go away! I wanted to call back. What did I ever do?

I was fenced in, drowning.

It was a long time before I finally dragged myself out of the bed, undrew the curtains to let the sunlight pour in.

I deleted the app, after I felt some loss but did not return.
