The first snowflake landed on Lady Elena's telescope lens like a star falling to earth. From her perch in the highest tower of Whitecliff Castle, she tracked the comet's path through the winter sky, its tail blazing against the darkness like a silver ribbon.

"Three degrees northwest," she murmured, adjusting the brass instrument with gloved fingers. The castle's white stone walls glowed in the moonlight, standing sentinel over the surrounding forest like a pearl set in emerald velvet. Below, pine branches swayed in the bitter wind, their whispers carrying ancient secrets up to her window.

A knock at the heavy oak door broke her concentration. "My lady," her steward's voice wavered, "They're coming."

Elena's heart quickened, but her hands remained steady as she made her final calculations. For ten years, she had defended her right to study the stars, fighting against those who claimed a noblewoman's place was in the great hall, not the observatory. Now the Royal Academy's delegation had finally arrived to validate—or condemn—her research.

The torches in the courtyard below flickered to life like earthbound constellations, illuminating the procession of scholars in their midnight blue robes. Elena could smell woodsmoke and frost on the air, mingled with the sweet pine sap from the forest. The leather binding of her notebooks crackled as she gathered them, years of observations and theories pressed between their pages.

"Let them come," she whispered to the stars, her breath fogging in the frozen air. The comet streaked overhead like a banner of defiance, marking the beginning of something extraordinary. She had tracked its path, predicted its return, and tonight she would prove that science knew no gender.

Elena descended the spiral staircase, each step echoing against stone worn smooth by centuries of footsteps. The castle had stood here for a thousand years, its towers reaching toward the heavens like fingers grasping at stardust. Tonight, it would witness history.

In the great hall, flames leaped in the massive fireplace, casting dancing shadows on the tapestries. The delegation stood in a semicircle, frost still clinging to their beards and robes. Elena felt the weight of their skeptical gazes, heavy as chain mail.

"Gentlemen," she said, her voice clear and strong as a bell. "Welcome to Whitecliff Castle. The comet awaits us." She gestured to the tower stairs, a smile playing at her lips. "Shall we begin?"

Their time had come—both hers and the comet's—and she would make them see that the stars themselves cared nothing for earthly prejudices. Like her beloved castle, Elena stood proud and resolute, ready to illuminate the darkness with the light of discovery.
