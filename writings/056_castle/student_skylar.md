The path up to the castle was harsh and rugged. The skeletal trees loomed over the dirt path ominously and the cold wind whistled and danced.

Pip's boots dug into the dirt as she trudged up the mountain. She could vaguely see the stone castle silhouetted against the foggy sky like a giant. The air was so frigid her breaths came in short huffs that whirled out of her mouth like smoke.

Pip had to get to the castle, it was the safest place among the vast rolling fields and steep sloping mountains. Pip gritted her teeth and pushed on through the wind that pierced her like cold pins.

The wind swirled and danced around her taunting and mocking her, but Pip fiercely blocked them out. She knew she was getting closer. She could almost feel the warmth of the guest room.

It was so freezing that Pip's nose burned and her throat itched. She pulled her scarf over her mouth battled the roaring wind. One step after the other.

There was a sickening pop-crack. Pip yelped in pain. She landed on the ground. She couldn't get up. Her ankle was tangled by a vine. It bound her like a chain. Her foot was angled strangely.

Half of it was numb and the other half was screaming in pain. Tears flooded Pip's eyes.

"I have to keep going!" She whispered, her voice cracking.

The cold whipped her like thousands of lashes and the chain-like vines yanked her down but Pip kept going, agonizingly dragging herself across the ground with all the strength she could muster.

"Must. Go. On," She croaked, her throat dry and raspy.

And there it was. The finish line. A towering white stone castle, with tall, towering turrets and a cobbled path up to the door. She could hear the fire crackling merrily and feel the warm air wafting from the windows.

She had made it.
