The castle is surrounded by a thick evergreen forest, heavy with rows upon rows of bushy undergrowth and pine trees taller than a house. The building itself was a true marvel; white slate walls and spire points of towers piercing the sky.

It was a miracle I had found it at all; the surrounding scottish hills around are treacherous and had long been devoid of any human settlement.

The helicopter dips dangerously as the castle draws near; I grip the armrests tight.

"Approaching Castle Beaucroft!" The pilot calls, voice marred by static and shouting above the roar of the choppers. "Landing in ten!"

My pulse jumps, thumping faster than a rabbit. This has to be it. One of my biggest archeological Finds.

My stomach swoops as the helicopter dives; the sky swings by - a blanket of white and grey.

When we land, my wobbly legs are greeted with paved stone and gravel. The camera crew spreads out in a wing behind me, lenses clicking furiously, taking in every inch of the space.

I stand there, transfixed, unable to look away as the castle walls loom before me, perfect and impenetrable.

It looks even more impressive than I ever could have imagined in person.

The watchtowers are tall, taller than the trees, inlaid with carefully carved window and pointing into spikes that pierce the very clouds.

I realise my hands are trembling from anticipation. I reach forward and open the great mahogany front doors which have not been touched in centuries.

All of my hardwork, every event in my life, every rebuke, every setback, every doubt and criticism I had felt and pushed away to carry on had led to this very moment. My chest could burst.

A decade ago I could not have dreamed this up. I had been scolded, laughed at. And yet ...

The air is bitingly cool, smelling of old books and fresh pine. The filigree handle is smooth and intricately lined under my fingertips.

"Welcome to the real King Arthur's castle," I tell the cameras.

I step inside.
