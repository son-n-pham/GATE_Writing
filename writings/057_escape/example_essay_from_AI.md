The Yellow Eyes of Hope

The wall had always been there, a massive turquoise barrier between our worlds, its ancient bricks whispering secrets of separation. I wasn't like the other residents of the Divided City who scurried past like frightened rats, averting their eyes from the glowing orbs that watched us through the darkness. Those mysterious eyes, amber as harvest moons, had fascinated me since childhood.

My sleeve, crimson as fresh dawn, brushed against the rough surface as I traced the outline of yet another hole. The wall was like a dying star, its solid facade slowly crumbling into countless portal-sized gaps. A spider, delicate as a dancer, descended from the flickering bulb above, its web shimmering like strands of hope in the dim light.

"Hello?" I whispered, my voice trembling like autumn leaves. "I know you're there."

The eyes blinked, slow and deliberate as the tide. One moment they were there, golden as morning sunshine, and the next they vanished into the velvet darkness beyond. But this time, something different happened. A hand – pale as moonlight and surprisingly human – reached through the opening, its fingers extending toward me like branches seeking spring's first light.

My heart thundered against my ribs like a fist against a prison door. Every cautionary tale my grandmother had whispered about the wall's inhabitants echoed in my mind: "They're different," she'd warned. "Dangerous." But the hand remained, patient as mountains, waiting.

I thought of the rusty spade leaning against the wall, the one the City Guard had placed there as a warning of what happened to those who tried to dig through. But they had it wrong all along. The wall wasn't meant to be broken down – it was meant to be reached through.

With a deep breath that felt like diving into unknown waters, I stretched out my own hand. Our fingers touched, and in that moment, I understood. The creatures behind the wall weren't monsters – they were mirrors, reflecting our own fears and prejudices back at us. They had been reaching out all along, while we had been taught to turn away.

The connection lasted only seconds before the hand withdrew, leaving behind a small, warm stone that glowed with the same golden light as those mysterious eyes. A gift, a bridge between worlds, a reminder that sometimes the greatest walls exist not in brick and mortar, but in our minds.

That night, as I walked home clutching my luminous treasure, I noticed more hands reaching through the wall's openings, and more citizens cautiously approaching them. The rats that once skulked in fear now sat watching curiously, as if they too understood that change was coming to our divided world.

One touch, one moment of trust, had started it all. Sometimes the bravest thing we can do isn't tearing down the walls that divide us, but simply reaching through them, fingers extended in hope of finding something familiar in the unknown.
