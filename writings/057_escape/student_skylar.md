There it was, a hole in the wall, a sliver of light against the world of darkness I was trapped in. My breathing quickened like a bass drum. My heart was a bass drum thumping against my weak ribs.

I took a shaky step towards the small gap, legs like jelly.

I was up against it, an eye pressed to the crevice.

Click. Rumble.

I gasped raspily. The rumbling continued, growing louder in a dramatic crescendo. My ears covered at the noise, because it sounded so ugly, like nails scraping across a stone slab.

It was very slight at first.

But the sliver of light grew slightly wider. The bricks were slowly moving aside, scraping against each other.

My waxy eyes grew wide as saucers. I exhaled slowly and reached an arm through the gap. I pressed a pale skeletal finger to the wall.

The stone slabs shifted. The wall was moving. Freeing me. I could barely believe my eyes.

Light.

The warmth of light was something I hadn't felt in years. Not since I had been imprisoned for a horrendous crime I had never done, I could see a dim white light ahead of me, sticky with cobwebs.

As the bricks moved for the first time in what felt like forever, I stepped out into the light with sunken cheeks and thinning hair. I felt like a zombie.

But that didn't matter.

I was free. I knew one day it would happen. I knew that one day good would defeat evil. And I smiled with my cracked lips.
