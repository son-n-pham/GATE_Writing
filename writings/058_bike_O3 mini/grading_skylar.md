### Detailed Rubric Assessment

1. **Story Structure and Plot Flow (1/2 marks)**

- **Evidence:** “I sat on the couch, stuffing handful after handful of chips into my mouth. … With that, she grabbed my wrist and tried to heave me to my feet.”
- **Analysis:** The narrative has a beginning and a progression through conflict, but transitions between episodes are abrupt and lack a clearly developed middle and resolution.
- **Score Justification:** Basic structure is present but the flow of events is uneven.
- **Improvement Strategy:** Develop smoother transitions between scenes and include a more defined resolution.

2. **Atmosphere and Theme (1/2 marks)**

- **Evidence:** Descriptive lines such as “spraying crumbs and spit all over the carpet” create a vivid, if crude, setting.
- **Analysis:** There is an attempt to set the scene, but the atmosphere feels more descriptive than thematic, and the underlying theme remains unclear.
- **Score Justification:** Some atmospheric details are present but the overall mood and theme are inconsistently rendered.
- **Improvement Strategy:** Enhance thematic coherence and use setting details to reinforce the central message.

3. **Sensory Details (2/2 marks)**

- **Evidence:** “Stuffing handful after handful of chips,” “spraying crumbs and spit,” and “cool evening breeze, riding bikes…”
- **Analysis:** The narrative naturally incorporates multiple senses (taste, sound, touch, sight) that immerse the reader.
- **Score Justification:** Effective depiction of sensory experiences throughout the essay.
- **Improvement Strategy:** Continue to integrate sensory details but balance them with deeper emotional insight.

4. **Character Development (1/2 marks)**

- **Evidence:** The narrator’s defiant attitude and later regret hint at an inner conflict.
- **Analysis:** While the character is vividly portrayed, there is minimal evidence of personal growth or transformation over the course of the essay.
- **Score Justification:** The character is distinct but lacks a clear developmental arc.
- **Improvement Strategy:** Introduce moments of reflection that demonstrate personal growth or change.

5. **Sizzling Start (1/1 mark)**

- **Evidence:** The essay opens with an engaging and vivid description of the narrator’s actions.
- **Analysis:** The immediate focus on sensory details and a dynamic scene successfully hooks the reader.
- **Score Justification:** The opening is effective in drawing the reader in.
- **Improvement Strategy:** Maintain the engaging tone throughout the essay.

6. **Conflict Development (1/2 marks)**

- **Evidence:** Family conflict is evident when the mother intervenes, and the physical struggle is described.
- **Analysis:** The conflict is introduced clearly; however, it remains underdeveloped and does not progress towards a compelling resolution.
- **Score Justification:** A basic conflict is present but lacks complexity and resolution.
- **Improvement Strategy:** Elaborate on the conflict’s underlying causes and explore its consequences more deeply.

7. **Figurative Language (2/3 marks)**

- **Evidence:** Phrases like “planted to the couch as firmly as a fat oak tree” and “weighing me down like a stone.”
- **Analysis:** The essay uses similes effectively to illustrate the narrator’s state, though additional varied figurative expressions could strengthen the narrative.
- **Score Justification:** Two distinct examples of figurative language are used effectively.
- **Improvement Strategy:** Incorporate more varied examples, such as metaphors or personification, to enhance expressive depth.

8. **Moral/Theme Message (0/2 marks)**

- **Evidence:** The essay touches on issues like overindulgence and familial concern, but does not explicitly deliver a moral lesson.
- **Analysis:** There is no clear or emerging moral message, leaving the reader without a defined takeaway.
- **Score Justification:** The narrative lacks a thoughtful moral or thematic resolution.
- **Improvement Strategy:** Introduce a subtle moral insight that emerges naturally from the character’s experience.

9. **Ending (1/2 marks)**

- **Evidence:** The final lines shift from present conflict to wistful regret.
- **Analysis:** The conclusion signals a desire for change, but it is abrupt and leaves several narrative threads unresolved.
- **Score Justification:** The ending is present but does not fully tie together the elements of the narrative.
- **Improvement Strategy:** Craft a more satisfying conclusion that addresses the conflict and emphasizes the character’s journey.

10. **Original Idea (0/1 mark)**

- **Evidence:** The narrative’s focus on overeating and family conflict is a familiar theme.
- **Analysis:** The idea does not present a unique twist or fresh perspective.
- **Score Justification:** The concept is conventional without notable creative innovation.
- **Improvement Strategy:** Experiment with original plot elements or unexpected narrative turns to set the story apart.

11. **Technical Accuracy (0/1 mark)**

- **Evidence:** Multiple punctuation inconsistencies and slight grammatical errors are present (e.g., inconsistent capitalization and punctuation in dialogue).
- **Analysis:** The writing contains more than one error, impacting the overall professionalism of the text.
- **Score Justification:** Frequent technical errors detract from the clarity of the narrative.
