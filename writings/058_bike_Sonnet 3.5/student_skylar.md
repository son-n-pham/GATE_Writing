I sat on the couch, stuffing handful after handful of chips into my mouth. My eyes were glued to the screen on which a cartoon was playing.

I chewed loudly, spraying crumbs and spit all over the carpet.

Mum bit her lip fretfully, "Sue darling," She said, her voice wobbly. "Would you mind eating those chips somewhere else?"

I shot her an angry look with my piggy eyes but returned to staring at the television.
"Sue darling," Mum tried again. "Would you mind going out for a bike ride, perhaps. You should really get some exercise," She eyed my thick folds of flab and fatty arms.

I grunted and the chips muffled everything I said. Mum huffed, stormed over and snatched the remote, turning the screen off with a click.
"Honestly," She snapped. "You've been living on the couch. It's like living with an addicted pig."

With that, she grabbed my wrist and tried to heave me to my feet.

But she couldn't.

She grunted and strained and heaved but I was planted to the couch as firmly as a fat oak tree.
"You're getting so heavy lately," She groaned as I wouldn't budge.

Dad came running in like a firefighter to the rescue and he and mum pulled until my arms were numb. Mum looked at me sternly, straight in the eye.
"Stand up."

I just couldn't. The horrific amount of weight I gained was weighing me down like a stone. I panted and flailed until I was so weary I just wanted to collapse and fall asleep.

I sighed and curled up into a little ball, worn out like a used towel.

I wished I hadn't eaten so much chips and watched so much television. I sighed and fiddled with the flabby fat folds in my neck. I wished I could be playing out in the cool evening breeze, riding bikes with my friends and running barefoot across the lush green parks listening to the sweet night-time songs of the birds. I wanted to be sitting on the sand at the beach, letting the sand squeeze between my toes.

But here I was.

Lying curled on a couch surrounded by chip crumbs with my rusty unused bike, a bike soon to be polished.
