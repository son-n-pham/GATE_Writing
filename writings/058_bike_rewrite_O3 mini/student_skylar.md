"Come on," Sue whispered coaxingly, softly stroking the white fur on my head. I drew back and my eyes grew wide as saucers with terror. "It's nice out here," She said calmly and kindly. "It's safe."

I whimpered and scurried further away meowing indignantly. I watched the wind dance rhythmically through Sue's dark hair, studying it cautiously. The whispering wind looked cold, even freezing.

I scampered further away, my paws pattering on the smooth, marble floor. Sue crouched down and smiled warmly. I gazed into her eyes, glittering brown oasises glowing with comfort.

I slowly moved one pink paw to the door, but my tail pricked up like an alarm every time I heard a sudden noise. I yelped in terror as Sue's green bucket flew off with the wind, soaring like a bird across the lush green garden, over the winding bridge and around the old blue bike.

Sue laughed and reached out a hand. I cautiously trotted over and licked it with my salmon-pink tongue.

"Come on," She whispered, egging me on with every step I made.

My insides were writhing with terror, but deep in my nine hearts, I knew Sue's warm smile would support me.

I was at the door, and the vastness of the garden overwhelmed me - tall swaying trees, a twisting wooden bridge and an old baby blue bike.

I took a deep breath, breathing in the sweet, crisp air.

And then I ran.

I scampered out the door into the big world of nature for the first time. I rolled through the waving daisies and onto the bridge. The wind was cooling and refreshing, blowing my white fur. I climbed up to the petite wire basket on the bike and curled into a minute, happy furball.

Sue was jogging behind me, out of breath. I meowed happily. Then, like a courageous adventurer, she leaped onto the bike and we were off, gliding as fast as a motorbike onto the bridge and out the gate onto the road, leaving all of my petty worries and terrors behind.
