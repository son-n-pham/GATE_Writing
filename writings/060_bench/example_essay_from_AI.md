Above and Below

The orange sky blazed like molten copper as I sat on the black and white striped bench, my grandmother's weathered hand clasped in mine. The surreal landscape around us bloomed with impossible flowers – their petals twisting like paper origami in the warm breeze. "I remember when you were little," she whispered, her voice carrying the weight of decades, "you used to say the earth held secrets."

I smiled, remembering my childhood theories. Back then, everything seemed possible, even the idea that beneath our feet lay another world entirely. The stylized trees around us cast strange shadows that danced across the ground like living creatures, and for a moment, I felt that old curiosity stirring.

"Close your eyes," Grandmother said suddenly, her grip tightening ever so slightly. "Remember how we used to imagine?"

As my eyelids fluttered shut, the world shifted. The bench beneath me seemed to dissolve, and I felt myself sinking – not falling, but floating gently downward like a autumn leaf. The air grew cool and soft around me, and the chattering of birds above faded into a profound, peaceful silence.

In this underground sanctuary, I curled into myself, comfortable as a child in the womb. The earth didn't feel like dirt or stone, but like a thousand tiny cushions, each one perfectly placed to cradle my body. Through my closed eyes, I could still sense the shadows of the trees and bench above, their patterns writing stories on the ground around me.

A smile crept across my face as I realized something: my childhood self hadn't been wrong after all. The earth did hold secrets – not of hidden civilizations or buried treasure, but of the quiet spaces we carry within ourselves. Places where memories and dreams intertwine, where past and present meet like old friends on a striped bench under an orange sky.

I opened my eyes to find myself back on the bench, my grandmother's hand still in mine. She was watching me with knowing eyes, her smile mirroring my own. Above us, the surreal trees swayed gently, while below, I knew, lay the sanctuary I could now return to whenever I needed – a place where imagination and reality danced together like shadows on the ground.

"You were right," I told her, squeezing her hand. "Some secrets are meant to be remembered."

The orange sky deepened to rose, and somewhere between above and below, past and present, youth and age, we sat together, keepers of the space between worlds.
