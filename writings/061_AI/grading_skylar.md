### Detailed Rubric Assessment

1. Story Structure and Plot Flow (2/2 marks)

- Evidence: Clear progression from email discovery → internal conflict → journey → reunion
- Analysis: The story follows a perfect three-act structure with excellent pacing
- Score Justification: Clear beginning (email discovery), middle (internal conflict and journey), and end (reunion) with smooth transitions
- Improvement Strategy: While structure is strong, consider incorporating the prompt's themes of technology/digital connection more centrally into the plot

2. Atmosphere and Theme (1/2 marks)

- Score Justification: While atmospheric details are present, the theme diverges significantly from the prompt
- Improvement Strategy: Integrate the prompt's technological elements while maintaining the emotional depth

3. Sensory Details (2/2 marks)

- Evidence: "eyes grew as wide as teacups", "face was a sheet of clammy white", "tears rushing down my cheeks like a salty waterfall"

- Score Justification: Three or more different examples used effectively
- Improvement Strategy: Consider varying types of figurative language (personification, metaphor)

9. Ending (2/2 marks)
