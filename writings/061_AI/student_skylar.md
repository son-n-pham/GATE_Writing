I looked at the email. My eyes grew as wide as teacups. I blinked.

No. That couldn't have happened.

My breathing quickened like an accelerating car, and my face was a sheet of clammy white. I read the email over and over again. "After all this time," I whispered shakily. I could hear the email echoing through my brain.

Dear Sue,

It's been quite a while! I heard you moved to Perth, and I'm currently staying here for a nice, relaxing holiday. I've missed you so much. Is it okay if we meet up at the park at 6:30 pm at: McDoogle Park. Please let me know if you are busy! Sisters forever, right?

XOXO
Lou

I couldn't refuse. The guilt would weigh me down like a heavy stone. I sighed. I had forgotten Lou had ever existed, that felt bad enough. I couldn't remember if she liked bagels or jam donuts, would rather run or swim, or even what she looked like.

How was I supposed to meet her?

I checked my watch. It was quarter past six. I stood up and grabbed my sweater.

I carefully shut the front door and wandered down the pavement, numb with nervousness.

The world was a blur of colour spinning around me and I felt dizzy.

And then I saw her—Lou. Her curly black hair was tied in a messy bun, and she was waiting for me, little circular glasses perched on her nose.

She looked around and smiled warmly.

And it all came back in a rushing tsunami. Me and Lou racing across a lush green meadow. We were climbing a tree and Lou reached a pudgy hand out to haul me up onto a thick branch.

Tears flooded my eyes and they kept rushing down my cheeks like a salty waterfall of nostalgia, sadness, guilt, happiness, everything. My sister—she was there.

Waiting.

I ran over and hugged her. I could feel tears dampening my shirt and a sniff. And as the sun set over the horizon and the world was bathed in an orange glow, me and Lou cried with happiness and sadness.
