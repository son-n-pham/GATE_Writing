# The Final Touch

The makeup brush trembles in my hand as I add the final touches to my tiger-inspired face paint. Each stripe must be perfect – this isn't just another performance, it's my shot at joining Cirque du Soleil. The dressing room mirror, framed by warm glowing bulbs, reflects back years of dreams pinned to its edges: my first ballet recital ticket, the "SUNSET" license plate from Dad's old car that brought me to countless auditions, and photos of every role that led to this moment.

"Five minutes!" The stage manager's voice echoes down the hallway, sending my heart into a gymnastics routine of its own. I reach into the drawer, fingers brushing past the worn palm leaf fan from last summer's tropical showcase. The familiar texture of my lucky wig brings a smile – I won't need it today. This performance is about being authentically me.

A drop of glue has dried on the vanity where I attached my false eyelashes an hour ago. Beside it, the measuring tape I used to perfect my costume alterations curls like a sleeping snake. I pick up the hairdryer, its warm breath taming my wild mane into submission. The scent of hairspray mingles with greasepaint, that intoxicating perfume of showbusiness that still makes my heart race after all these years.

My hand hovers over the guitar leaning against the wall – a pre-show ritual since my street performing days. But today, something different catches my eye. There, tucked behind my stage makeup, is a small card I don't recognize. In my mother's elegant handwriting: "The stage is just a mirror reflecting your light back to the world."

The lights around my mirror flicker once, like a cosmic wink. I straighten my shoulders and watch my reflection transform – no longer a nervous performer but a fierce tiger ready to leap. My fingers grasp the door handle, cool metal grounding me in this moment.

"Show time," I whisper, and for the first time today, my voice doesn't shake.
