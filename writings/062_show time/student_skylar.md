Show Time

Pip pokes her head into my dressing room. "You alright?" I laugh shakily and smile under a mask of thick confidence. "Never been better - I'm pretty excited, really," I say loudly and boldly, lying through my teeth. Pip grins back, teeth like a happy beaver's. Her face brightens like the sun after a cloudy day and she wanders down the corridor.

I sigh and let all of my worries drown me like a gigantic flood. I look up at my light-studded mirror - at all of the bright and colorful pictures and stickers I had plastered on there over the years.

I know deep in my soul that performing is my life, but it's hard to sing, dance and act in front of a crowd of thousands. I slowly breathe in, and out, trying to soothe my tsunami of nerves.

I pick up my guitar and try to strum a few uplifting and relaxing chords, but my fingers go stiff as stone and I drop the purple pick to the floor.

I stare into the mirror, and a sweaty, clammy and pale-faced girl stares back at me, red fizzy hair a mess. Then the girl that looks like me winks. I blink. She picks up a guitar and strums it with a purple pick. Wind dances through the messy red bird's nest on her head and whistles. I stare back. The girl in the mirror nods and gives me a firm thumbs up.

I can't believe my eyes. Is the girl in the mirror me, the girl I wish to be, or the other untouched, loud and confident side of myself? I just sit in front of the mirror and gaze at the strange girl. I am a gaping fish dreaming about a graceful flamingo. I can't help but wonder that the bold, brash and playful girl I was watching, as if in a dream, was me.

She waved at me. I almost hear her whisper, "Show time!" As she gently fades away.

The door suddenly creeks open behind me. Pip is back, her electric blue eyes sparkling. "You're up," she chants, reaching out to high five me. I grin widely, pick up my pick and lace my black boots, while adjusting my messy red hair - only slightly. "So excited," I smiled, and this time genuinely.

It is really show time.
