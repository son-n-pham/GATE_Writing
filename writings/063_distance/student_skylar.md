Pip didn't even look back. She marched on straight ahead like a determined soldier. The mocking wind danced teasingly through my short brown bob as I watched Pip's frizzy red hair disappearing further away down the path.

I tried to jog and keep up, but it was like chasing a fly that didn't want to be caught. Pip was keeping her distance—even avoiding me. I panted and sweat came dribbling down my face. My cheeks and ears turned tomato red, and my new heavy bag thumped on my back, until it entirely tumbled off, its contents flying.

Pip was striding forwards, out of the cool shade underneath the thick oaks, and into the bright sunlight outside. I just stood and watched as my splintered pencils rolled around at my feet.

Pip was skipping ahead, her magenta bag merely a light feather resting on her back. I sighed and tried to blink back fat tears as I ducked back into the shadows, crouching down to pick up my pencils and dirt-covered books.

Soon the tears were rolling down my cheeks and all of a sudden all my papers were soaked through and the tears were a salt waterfall. The wind giggled and whispered, slapping me in the face rudely with sharp, sudden gusts.

I could see Pip's hair, a red speck in the distance. I could hear loud laughing and whispered insults. Pip was my friend. I sniffed and wiped my tear-stained glasses. My fingers fumbled to pick up my slippery pencils, but my hands were stiff as stones.

The last pencil was stuffed into the front pocket and I was finally zipping it up. I breathed a sigh of relief and stood up, stretching. I stretched my arms up until my fingertips lightly brushed the leaves—letting my backpack slide off with a thump.

I was marching off proudly to join Pip, when I realized why I was skipping so fast and why I was no longer sore. The realization hit like a fast and deadly tsunami crashing over me and pulling me under.

My toe had just touched the light by a millimeter when I turned round and had to slump back. I looked longingly to Pip and her new friends as I piled my wet papers into my bag.

I felt alone, no one but the leaves and the old, deaf trees to accompany me. That's when I heard a twig snap and some leaves rustle. "You need help?"
