Mr. Flat stood at the front of the classroom, massaging his plump, sausage-like fingers. His face was absurdly like a rectangle, with straight folds of pink flab that curved into unnaturally sharp corners. He stood tall and demanding in front of the bland grey classroom. His shoulders were broad, and his grey suit emphasised the absolute squarness of him.

He was a moving sheet of grey metal that consisted of squares, rectangles and dullness in hues of grey. You could not see his piggy little eyes, because they were hiding behind steel framed, square glasses that always seemed to fog up.

Mr. Flat observed his new batch of students, sitting like grey, sad gingerbread girls and boys, just sitting on the baking tray. Mr Flat called out the roll in an expressionless monotone - not far from a robot's.

"This school," he said, his voice dragging like nails across a blackboard. "Does not tolerate books."

Most students were surprised, but some of the more intelligent ones had already seen that coming.

A bright girl raised her hand. Her hair was a fizzy vivid red and her bright green eyes sparkled.

"What's the name," Mr Flat said.

"Pippy-Anne Charlotte Orlando!" The girl piped up immediately, sitting straight up like an attentive soldier.

"Pippy-Anne's not a name."

"Oh yes it is sir!"

Pippy-Anne nodded patronisingly, and under Mr Flat's thick square layers of fat he writhed with disgust.

"Anyways, sir, there should be books sir, it's a school sir!" Pippy-Anne insisted.

Mr. Flat's pink face slowly changed to a grape purple faster than you could flick a light on.

"Get out of my school then girl number 46."

Pippy-Anne huffed and stormed out of the dull room. She didn't look where she went. The grey corridors twisted like a labyrinth around her. Her footsteps echoed, mingling with her huffs.

Pippy-Anne kicked open a random door and slipped inside, sitting down with a thud on the cold stone floor. The room was dark, so much so Pippy-Anne couldn't see her fingers. She squinted and she could just see a rectangular silhouette against the fathomless black.

She cautiously edged towards it, her fingers brushing the surface. She recognised it. It was a shelf - and on top of it were lined two dusty books.

Was this a library?
