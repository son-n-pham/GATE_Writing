# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "The image depicts a person from the back, presumably at an airport or immigration checkpoint. The person has brown hair and is wearing a yellow shirt and a blue backpack. They are holding a passport and what appears to be a boarding pass in their hand. Behind the person are two white doors with red 'no entry' signs on them. The overall color scheme is muted, with whites, blues, yellows, and browns dominating the scene.\n\nThe writing task requires students to interpret the scene, possibly creating a story or narrative around the person's journey, purpose, and destination. They might also explore themes of travel, identity, or immigration. The text 'Passport' at the top of the image further emphasizes this theme.\n\nThis image serves as a prompt by providing a visual narrative starting point. Students can use the details in the image, such as the passport, backpack, and 'no entry' signs, to develop a story about the person's travel experience, challenges, and personal motivations. The ambiguity of the scene encourages creative interpretation and storytelling."
