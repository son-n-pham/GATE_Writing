Writing by second it was there—then it wasn't. My palm was empty. Panic washed over me like a tidal wave of panic and terror. I looked down at my sweaty palm, which was very empty.

It was gone. My passport.

My ticket fluttered to the floor like a dying butterfly. Dead. The massive airport seemed to close in on me, its mocking laugh bouncing and echoing off the bare white walls.

Tears sprang up from inside me like an unwanted geyser, spilling and gushing down my cheeks in a miserable and salty waterfall.

By then, the waiting room fell unnaturally silent, the silence broken by occasional whispers and giggles. Forty-nine pairs of eyes were staring openly at me, and ninety-eight eyebrows shot up like firecrackers.

I gulped, wiped a tear, and coughed awkwardly.

Someone else coughed, and soon, quiet murmurs rose to loud talking. I sighed, crouching down to pick up my ticket.

Still no passport. I felt like a trodden-on mouse, carelessly stepped on by two cruel giants—the giant of losing things and the giant of complete humiliation.

I slumped to the ground. Did I have to ask at the help station?

I gloomily sat up and slouched over to the help desk.

When I felt a gentle tap-tap on my shoulder, like gently falling rain, "Excuse me," whispered a small and high-pitched voice. I whipped around, squinting through blurry and teary eyes at a small girl. She had mousy brown hair and a small nose.

"I think you dropped this," she piped up, holding up a black passport and handing it to me with short, stubby fingers. "My passport," I breathed.

It looked a little trampled on, but the gold letters still gleamed. The little girl looked up at me with her big, innocent hazel eyes.

I smiled weakly as tears trickled down my cheeks. "Thanks a lot," I shifted, wiping my nose. The small girl beamed up at me and skipped away.
