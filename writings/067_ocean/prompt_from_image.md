# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "I see an underwater scene with two scuba divers swimming around a large, crystalline object. The object is dodecahedron-shaped and appears to be glowing from within. Sunlight streams down from the surface of the water, creating rays of light. There are schools of fish scattered around the scene, and coral reefs can be seen at the bottom. The water is a deep blue color, fading to lighter shades near the surface. Above the image there is text saying \"Underwater\".\n\nThe writing task requires students to describe an underwater scene or to create a narrative around the divers and the mysterious object.\n\nThis image serves as a prompt by providing a vivid and imaginative setting, which could inspire a variety of stories or descriptive pieces. It can prompt students to consider themes such as exploration, mystery, and the beauty of the underwater world."
