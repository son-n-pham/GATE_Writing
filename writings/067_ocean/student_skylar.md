Underwater Jewel Quest

The water was cold. The salty waves roared all around me, like a vicious beast. Sam looked down at me and bit her lip fretfully. "You know Pip, you don't have to go down there..." She said, her voice wobbly.

I knew I was nervous, I was as scared as a lonely mouse, but I had to find the jewel. I had to.

I smiled broadly under my diving mask and gave Sam a big thumbs-up. Sam nodded shakily and waved at me, like it was the last time she'd ever see me. I kept my mask of confidence on, but it was made of thin glass.

I took a deep breath of the cool, dancing wind, then submerged. The mask shattered. The cruel waves tossed me over and over like I was only an inconvenient toy. I could feel my lips changing from grape purple to an electric blue.

My heavy oxygen tank was a rock, weighing me down, pulling me deeper into the frigid water.

My legs were dead, they flopped to the side like a useless tail as I sank. But ahead of me, in the murky water, I saw something. My hands.

My hands.

My breathing accelerated, and suddenly, I was paddling like a dog, my hands working furiously, cutting through the water like the blades of a grinder. My foggy brain started to function again, and soon, the words FIND JEWEL flashing like neon lights.

My wrists ached and ached, but I plowed on, the rows of jagged coral only a dark blur around me. The fish parted around me like the red sea, as I fought on, my tears covering my goggles.

And then I saw it.
A little blue speck that radiated with light, shining like a star. It got bigger. And bigger. It was simply enormous. I paddled right up to it, right up to the glistening jewel floating in the water. I had found it.

The end.
