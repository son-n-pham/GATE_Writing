The Watchers of Westralis Bay

The twin sentinels of ice loomed over our coastal town like ancient guardians, their crystalline faces reflecting the golden sunrise. From my bedroom window, I watched them change colors throughout the day – dawn's rose-gold giving way to afternoon's brilliant azure, then fading to twilight's deep indigo. These massive icebergs had drifted into our bay three months ago, transforming our quiet fishing village into an unlikely tourist attraction.

"They're getting smaller," Dad said one morning, his weathered hands wrapped around a steaming mug of coffee. As harbor master, he monitored the bergs daily, marking their slow dissolution on his charts. The warming waters were gradually reclaiming them, like time itself melting away our temporary visitors.

I remembered the day they arrived, materializing through the morning fog like ghostly ships. The fishing fleet had to chart new routes, and the old-timers at the dock muttered about changing currents and shifting weather patterns. But for me, they brought magic to our ordinary world. Tourists flocked to our shores, their cameras clicking like crickets, their faces filled with wonder as they gazed up at the towering ice mountains.

The icebergs became our town's heartbeat. Street vendors set up stalls selling "Iceberg Ice Cream" and "Frozen in Time" postcards. Local artists painted the bergs in every light, their canvases capturing the way sunbeams danced through the ancient ice like light through stained glass. Even the grumpiest residents admitted the bergs had brought new life to our sleepy community.

But nature's art exhibition couldn't last forever. Each day, the bergs shed tears of meltwater, their majestic shapes slowly transforming. Some mornings, we'd wake to thunderous cracks as another piece calved away, sending miniature tsunamis rippling through the harbor. The sea was reclaiming its children, piece by piece.

On the last day, as the smaller berg finally surrendered to the waves, I stood on the beach with my classmates. We watched in reverent silence as the ice giant bowed its head beneath the surface, leaving behind only ripples and memories. The remaining berg seemed to stand straighter, as if accepting its role as the lone sentinel of our bay.

That evening, as the sun painted the sky in flames of orange and pink, I realized the icebergs had taught us something valuable. Like these majestic visitors, nothing lasts forever – but everything leaves its mark on the world, changing those who witness its passing. And sometimes, the most extraordinary moments in life come from unexpected arrivals on our doorstep, reminding us that every day holds the potential for wonder.
