I was made of water, frozen into an iceberg. I've overlooked the coast of Westralis for years and years now, staring at the twisting snake like roads, and little wooden houses being built, then demolished. Everyday, some group of humans dressed in heavy winter coats and oggle at me curiously.

How tightly they were bundled up reminded me of when the highwaymen tied thick hankerchiefs around their faces while they robbed elaborate coaches of silk and gold, drinking up everylast piece of treasure like a hyena.

And when the grass withered under summer's spell, I gazed out under my icy eyelids and watched. The water lapped against my broad shoulders as I bobbed and floated among the cruel, relentless waves.

I was a powerful guardian, watching over my little town- a proud lion, protecting its cub. Every day the fierce wind dances around me, lashing out at my face with razor sharp claws made of harsh gusts of gale. Every day, I felt myself getting weaker and weaker.

I could almost hear myself creak like a weary dog and whine like a hungry dog, and I knew I couldn't last much longer. As I looked out to my little town of Westralis, I smiled. I would miss how the birds perched on the powerlines, and how the cars criss crossed and glided along.

And there, as the morning light bathed the world with light, I cracked, and like the mighty titanic, I trembled and my head sank underneath the cold water.
