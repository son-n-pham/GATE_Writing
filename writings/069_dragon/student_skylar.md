Something moved through the old waving willow trees. Something that slithered like a snake, even though Pip could hear loud, echoing thumps and the sound of leaves scattering like terrified mice.

Pip crept forward, as stealthy as a ninja and darted around, her little, small feet pattering on the ground. The wind dancing around her swirled faster as Pip's imagine curiosity piqued. Pip knew she was going to find a dragon. All the years of "Dragons don't exist dummy," and "as if some midget as tiny as you, could ever even think about a dragon and not faint."

Pip quickly blinked back salty tears that threatened to cascade down in a waterfall, and kept her mind set onto finding the dragon: "I can't back down now," she thought fiercely: "I'm so close!" Pip was a mice with the heart and courage of a mighty lion.

These confident words emboldened Pip, and she slyly slipped though the forest like a cunning stream of water, following the slither-thump-thump.

And then she finally saw it.

It was blurry at first, but as Pip tiptoed further, a pair of bright yellow eyes were fixed firmly upon her. Pip gasped. There in the middle of a sunbathed clearing stood a strange winged creature. It had a scaly green serpentine tail that curled around. It's little wings flapped gently, and it's horns imposing.

Pip and the dragon observed eachother, the dragon with weary curiosity, and Pip with frightened inquisitiveness.

"Hello." She whispered cautiously, stepping closer.

And in those soft, strange words was a sort of knowing. Pip and the dragon knew that the other was like an elephant-giant and imposing, but also kind and gentle.

"I think we can be good friends." Pip smiled warmly, and the corner of the dragons mouth twitched.
