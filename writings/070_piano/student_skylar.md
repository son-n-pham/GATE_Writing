The Sunriser

The clockwork in my brain whirred almost as fast as the clogs turning on the wall. My hands danced across the piano as gold dust swirled up around me. My hands ached and ached, but I had to keep on playing. My wrists were red and I couldn’t keep up.

The world spun faster than ever in a dizzying blur as I slammed down onto the piano. The fate of the world rested upon my weary shoulders —on the magic dust— on the piano.
As my hands worked quicker than ever, the dust clouded my vision, and the world was nothing but gold and sweet melodic music.

Above me, the giant clogs grinded against each other, moving so fast they could spark a fire. I panted as my playing rose in a crescendo —this moment was crucial, I had to do this or the sun would never rise.

I was my fingers were moving so fast they were numb —everything was numb. The clogs spun faster and faster against the starry night sky above me and the dust danced like fireflies.

And as I slammed the last resounding notes on the piano the clogs gave a groan and stopped. I threw my head back and breathed heavily, letting the sweat drip of me — it was dew dripping of a leaf after a storm.

I gazed up at the sky with my hopeful grey eyes. Did I do it right? My heart was beating like a bass drum, thymping against my ribs as I sat and waited.
And then it came. The sky was streaked with soft, pale orange strokes as the sun rose, like a butterfly bursting out of its cocoon. I was bathed in warm light and exhaled in relief. It had worked. It was over. But I knew I had to do it again tonight.

And the night after.

The sun could never rise without a Sunriser.
