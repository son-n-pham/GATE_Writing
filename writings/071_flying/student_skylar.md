The wind swirled around and around. It was like a gentle tornado, lifting things of the ground with dancing gusts. "Great day for flying," Pip grinned. Everyone else laughed and clapped their hands, cheering mockingly. "Sure!" Sam called. "I'd love to go out there and get whipped up into a smoothie!" There was a smacking of hands and some roaring laughter.

Pip frowned and shook her head. "No, no, I mean actually. With my umbrella and everything, like that Mary Poppins lady." Sam laughed so hard he started to cough. "Yeah right explain-thingy you are so precious." Pip huffed and stormed away. "Tiny little brains." she muttered, throwing on her gum boots and a blue raincoat. She yanked her umbrella off the hat stand and marched off, but her hand rested on the rusted door-handle.

"I can do this," she said firmly, gritting her teeth and opening the door with a creak.

The cold wind almost knocked her off her feet as it danced fiercely around her. It's greedy little hands scooped up diamonds rings and old paintings, knocking over a porcelain jar. "No!" Pip cried as her child hood stuffed teddy soared out of the open door and circled up towards the stormy grey sky.

Pip slammed the front door behind her and opened her umbrella fighting back against the wind that was like icy whips. And then she stopped fighting back. The wind picked her up as if she was a feather and started her ascent.

The murky clouds above her came closer as her little town grew smaller and smaller, now, only pinpricks in the distance. Soon, Pip was passing through the fluffy white clouds - then she was above the sky, hovering among the stars.
