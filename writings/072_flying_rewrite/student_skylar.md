It was mildly windy, with the breeze lightly licking the trees like a playful dog. The sky above me was a bland blanket of fluffy cotton-like clouds.
"The clouds are like a bladder," I commented as I gazed up at the sky above me.
"Weird." Sue muttered, wrinkling her nose.
"Little girls like you probably always say stupid knowing things---like comparing the sky to wee..."
I had learned to muffle my sister's harsh language, but it still stung like a bee sting. I sat down and took off my thongs, letting the grass tickle my toes.
I stared up at the clouds, letting the breeze dance merrily through my black hair.
"We could easily fly up there with an umbrella," I mused.
Sue laughed humorlessly, but I brandished my spotted umbrella like a great medieval sword once used by a courageous knight.
I held the umbrella in front of me, my little spidery fingers gripping the handle tightly. I took a deep, shaky breath and slowly raised the root of the umbrella towards the sky.
"Good luck on your 'flight'!" Sue snickered, taking out a big, black book labeled 'Dracula'.
I smiled firmly, but my thoughtful amber eyes were gazing on the sky, as a gust of wind gently lifted me off my feet.
I grinned as I levitated upwards.
Every little gust were hands pushing me inch by inch off the ground. I was flying--like a real bird! I could see my little town, shrinking below me, little neat rows of little red brick houses emitting petite puffs of smoke. I really laughed as I saw the clouds up close, they were almost as fluffy as stuffing. Soon, everything was a passing blur around me and--floof!
My head stuck out of the clouds like a mole. I giggled and my head stuck out of the clouds--above the sky!
I laughed and wooped. I was above the clouds--above the sky! There were twinkling stars everywhere and great planets encircled with glowing rings. I felt weightless. I was weightless. I twirled in a circle and smiled up at my spotted umbrella, we were really above the sky! It was so unbelievable, so strange. With that comforting thought I reached down to wave at my sister, Sue.
