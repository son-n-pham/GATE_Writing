Once there was a girl, who had an umbrella.

It wasn’t any ordinary umbrella, per se; she’d found it in a garage sale, digging in the back after Old Man Billy had disappeared around the corner, shuffling slowly on his oaken walking stick and mumbling things about debt and government corruption, whatever that was.

The umbrella was a little broken; one of the metal rods holding up the wide black brim had cracked and was hanging loose like a broken arm.

The girl took this umbrella, and walked all the way home. The soles of her bare feet were tough as leather and brown with dirt.

Like a monkey she scaled the drainpipe of the red brick building, carefully avoiding the window until she found the small nook she had carved for herself among the neighbouring branches of a poplar tree and the stout chimney, whom she had nicknamed Mr. Stanley. A crooked face had been drawn across it, pale and pink against the red. She would retrace the smile every day, lest it wash away from sun or rain.

She stuck the umbrella over the chimney, gave it a back on the cheek and the usual greeting.

“Afternoon, Mr. Stanley. It’s all fair weather and smiles, today!” It was something she had heard the matron from across the road say.

The chimney smirked back at her. She’d made the eyes a little too frowny, the eyebrows drawing down. The girl reached between the branches that clung to the side of the roof and pulled out the bucket she had kept there, a rusted old tin thing that smelled of old coins and fish. The chalk rattled in the pail as she fished it out and fixed Mr. Stanley’s face. She smoothed the eyebrows back, made them creep upwards rather than downwards.

The face seemed happier now, although the eyebrows were a touch too thick.

She replaced the chalk and sat under the umbrella in the shade and watched an old automobile cough up smoke as it crawled across the road down below.

She wondered if automobiles could fly. They didn’t have wings, of course, but if they did would it work?

She tried to think back to the sketches and diagrams of biplanes she’d seen once, although she couldn’t quite remember what they looked like. They did have wings, but not fanned and feathered like a bird. More rectangular, perhaps.

Did she even need a biplane? She could have a balloon. One big enough to lift her up into the air and away.

The wind shifted and the umbrella toppled against her back.

The girl scrambled to retrieve it, toes hooking against the slats on the roof to avoid slipping.

She paused, grasping the brolly’s handle.

Could umbrellas fly?

She tried to imagine it, picture a wind strong enough to lift her up into the air, pushing against the wide brim like flower petals, lifting it high up. She would hold on, of course, let the air currents carry her.

She would rise up, through the clouds, climbing higher than any person, any bird had ever flown. What was up there? More clouds? More sky?

The girl pictured it in her mind’s eye.

Stars.

Yes, that was it.

The clouds tended to hide them, but up high there would be plenty, shining brilliantly in their bountifulness. Like glittering gems they would blind her and she would fly, marvelling in their beauty. Streaks of silver light, sparkling jewels.

Maybe she could bring them back home. Mr. Stanley would like them.

She turned the umbrella in her fingers and lifted it up to the sky.

A toast, of sorts.

She would fly one day, she would be sure of it.

And Mr. Stanley would be right behind her.

She grasped the handle of the umbrella triumphantly, and jumped.
