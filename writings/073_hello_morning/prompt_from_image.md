# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "I see a whimsical cartoon illustration titled \"MORNING SURPRISE\". The central figure is a pink, cartoonish octopus wearing a tiny black hat, with a smiling face. A speech bubble above it says \"Hello!\". The octopus is positioned on a wooden countertop that has a built-in black cooktop, and its tentacles dangle over the edge of the counter, some with cartoonish water droplets falling from them. The countertop is part of a kitchen setup, with white cabinets and stainless steel kitchen accessories visible in the background. The overall color palette is bright and cheerful, with a focus on pink, brown, white, and black.\n\nThe writing task requires students to create a story based on the image, focusing on the unusual subject of an octopus in a kitchen, the greeting it offers, and the implied scenario of a 'morning surprise'.\n\nThis image serves as a prompt by offering a surreal and humorous scenario that invites imaginative storytelling. The combination of the ordinary (a kitchen) and the extraordinary (an octopus with a greeting) creates a narrative hook. The title further suggests an element of surprise or unexpectedness, encouraging the writer to explore the events and circumstances surrounding the octopus's appearance and its interaction with the kitchen environment.",
