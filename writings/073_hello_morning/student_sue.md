Tabb would always remember the day she had found an octopus in her kitchen sink.

Her parents weren't home that day - Dad had disappeared to America for an "important business trip" while Mum had gone off to the shopping mall to buy vegetables with her girlfriends.

Tabb sat perched at the edge of the dining table, swinging her legs back and forth as she hummed something to herself. A tune she'd heard on the radio, perhaps, although she couldn't quite remember how it ended. She tried to make it up, conjuring melodies in her mind.

Her squeaky voice cracked as the notes teetered dangerously high.

The book was spread out in front
of her. Sound Waves, scrawls of text accompanied with pictures of other children doing things, painting a rainbow, walking to school.

She scribbled a picture of a flower in the corner, gave it a smiley face like it was the sun. Suns always had smiley faces.

A smear of ink smudged got onto her finger so Tabb get up to wash her hands.

"It's very important to wash your hands," Mother would always say, quite seriously.

She had to balance on her tiptoes to reach the tap, and when she did she saw that the sink was filled high with water, nearly till overflowing.

The water was cloudy with sand, which was strange ~ Mother always made sure to keep the drain unplugged.

Something darted below the surface, a flash of something fleshy and pink. The water burbled.

Tabb froze.

She leaned in close, cautious, her fingers just breaking the surface and sending tremors rippling across the water. The thing darted.

A pink tendril erupted from the sink, flicking splashes of water into her face. she yelped

Tabb jumped back in surprise, wiping droplets out of her eyes.

Another flashing of pink, a tangle of seaweed flopping out and onto the counter.

Small, black eyes blinked back at her, tentacles uncoiling into eight individual limbs.

Tabb's breath caught. She knew what this was! An octopus!

The octopus stared back at her shiny eyes, large. It wiggled a tentacle at her. Hello, it seemed to say.

Tabb waved back at it. "Hello."

Its beak clicked. It leapt out of the sink in a great wet splatter and landed on the floor, scuttling on all eight tentacles like a spider.

Tabb hurried after it. "How did you get here?"

The octopus scrambled up the wall, leaving a slimy trail of water and seaweed in its wake.

She clambered after it, managed to corner it and Sweep it into a cup.

The octopus was very still as Tabb went to put it back in the sink.

"I know you're scared," she told it, "but I'll get you home. I promise."

The octopus glooped back at her.
