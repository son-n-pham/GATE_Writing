The fluorescent lights of Gate 33 hummed, casting a sterile glow on the embrace. Lily burrowed her face into her father's worn leather jacket, the scent of his familiar cologne a temporary shield against the ache in her chest. He smelled of home, of Sunday pancakes and bedtime stories, of scraped knees and whispered secrets. But home was a thousand miles away now, across an ocean she'd only seen on maps.

"It's going to be okay, peanut," Dad murmured, his voice thick with unshed tears. He squeezed her shoulders, his calloused hands offering a silent promise of strength. "Grandma needs you, and you're the bravest girl I know."

Lily sniffled, the image of Grandma's frail smile flashing in her mind. Grandma, who used to chase her around the garden with a watering can, who taught her how to bake apple pies, who always had a warm hug and a listening ear. Grandma was sick, and Lily was the only one who could go.

"I'll miss you," she whispered, the words catching in her throat.

"I'll miss you more," Dad replied, pulling back to look at her. His eyes, usually bright with laughter, were clouded with sadness. "But this isn't goodbye, Lily-bug. It's just... see you later."

He straightened her backpack, a bright pink monstrosity overflowing with her favorite books and stuffed animals. A small, worn teddy bear peeked out from the top, its button eyes staring blankly ahead.

"Take care of Bear," Dad said, his voice cracking slightly. "He'll keep you safe."

The announcement crackled over the loudspeaker: "Flight 427 to London, boarding now at Gate 33."

Lily's heart lurched. This was it.

She threw her arms around Dad one last time, squeezing him tight. "I love you," she mumbled into his jacket.

"I love you more, peanut," he whispered back. "Now go. Be brave. And don't forget to call."

Lily pulled away, her eyes blurred with tears. She picked up her backpack and walked towards the gate, each step heavy with the weight of separation. She glanced back one last time, Dad was still standing there, watching her, his figure silhouetted against the bright lights of the airport. She raised her hand in a shaky wave, a silent promise to return.

As she walked through the gate, she clutched Bear tightly in her arms, his soft fur a small comfort in the face of the unknown. London awaited, and with it, the daunting task of caring for Grandma. But she wasn't alone. She had Dad's love, Grandma's memory, and a small, worn teddy bear to guide her way.
