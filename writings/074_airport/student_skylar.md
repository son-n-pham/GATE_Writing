Sue gazed at the big stuffed teddybear, her eyes as large as saucers. She pressed her freckled nose against the cold glass, her one excited little puffs of breath creating a a small circle of fog.
"Daddy." She whispered her heart, a fast beating drum thumping against her ribs. "Gimmie that teddy weddy."
Dad was at marching ahead, the suitcase trailing behind him. He stopped and looked back, startled Sue was dawdling behind.
"Come on, Sue!" He called. "We'll be late for the plane!"
However, the stubborn, pauty toddler was planted firmly like a tree next to the airport toy store. As soon as Dad's back was turned, Sue darted as fast as lightning and snatched the teddy bear from the hook inside of the shop. She was so quick she was a ping-pong ball on the olympics-pinging off the walls in a dizzying blur.
"Sue?" Dad turned back around staring at her sternly.
"We'll be late for the plane."
Sue laughed giggled giddily and trotted over, the teddy bear clutched tightly behind her back. Worry was twisting itself into her small childish brain. She was surely going to be found out.
"Hurry!" Dad urged.
Sue was purposely walking slowly, trying to whistle like the disguised superheroes in her favourite films.

Dad could smell this mischief brewing. The acrid purple smoke twisted around him like a snake. He strode towards Sue frowning. It was extremely sudden, but right then, like a switch had been switched on, Sue burst into tears. They come rolling down her scarlet cheeks and splattered on the tiled floor.
"I hic did it!" Sue bawled between hiccups.
"Woah!" Dad said.
It took a while to console Sue. Dad patted her shoulder comfortingly and pulled her in close. Then he kneeled down and looked straight into his daughters watery eyes.
"Thank you for your honesty."
