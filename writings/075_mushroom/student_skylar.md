Tab and Betty sat on the long stick and gazed up at
the old mushroom in wonder. The warm dancing sunlight bathed
her spotted red cap and lit up Tab and Betty's awe.
"Have you ever heard," whispered the old mushroom,
smiling softly, "the Enoki Tales?"
The excitement inside of Betty roared like a fire,

The old mushroom grinned, and took out an old, dusty book that
was nestled among the waving grass. She flipped open a
