The storms roared and reared up like terrifying stallions.
Thunder split the sky in jagged white lines as the waver
crashed against the rocky shore. The mice rowed with all of
their strength-furry arms aching.
"It's hopeless!" The burliest mouse cried as a shower
of salty water splashed him all over.
His eyes were wild with fear and his sailors cap was
askew. The roaring waves made the petite life boat rock.
The dark grey sky a rumbled with thunder and set cruel,
dancing gusts of wind knocking the desperate mice off
course.

"SAVE US!" They all squeaked, as scared as an
boat of electrified cats.

All of them winced and cried out when the
crashed mercilessly upon them or when their paws turned
as red as a tomato, all except for Tim.

He had a little pink nose with long fine whiskers. Tim
always looked quite timid; for his eyes were always wide
and he was unbelievably short. However, Tim had a strong,
steel heart of courage.

"We're NOT going to die!" He squeaked in his high
pitched voice, but nobody heard him over the crashing
waves and crackling lightning.

His tufty white eyebrows narrowed with determination
as the fragile wooden boated surfed a wave; his oar
pushing the angry water behind them.

And then the massive wave came. It loomed menacingly
a giant about to strike. Most of the mice were to
afraid; swear they were cowering in the shadows, but
Tim kept on rowing and rowing and rowing and rowing
and rowing as the wave reared - and rowing harder as
it pounced... until-

"LIGHTHOUSE!" A mouse shrieked, exhilerated.
And he was right. There it was. A lighthouse, pulsating
with light and warmth. A wide smile spread across
Tim's dripping wet face. There was hope. They were
going to get rescued from the storm.
