What a strange little machine was the imaginator. It had
a curvy rusted funnel potruding out of the back the was belching
great clouds of smoke. A funny little wheel stuck out of the
side, and, there was a delicate glass measuring device sitting
atop the peeling blue toaster. There was another funnel,
a bit like a spout; it was not belching out thick plumes of
ugly smoke, however. It appeared to gently blowing life, and cloude
and a pearly sky out across the barren, dry landscape.

Then, a wonderful breeze wistfuly blew the smoke a way; some
quite daring dark puffs that leaned low to the
parched earth attempted to stay, but the joyful, sunny skies
and blissfully scudding clouds were blinding them, until they
were drifting away and disappeared.

The imaginator was grunting and wheezing. There were
little bright sparks of fire lighting up every few moments
until it entirely suffocated. Meanwhile, the 'life' was
blossoming and blooming everywhere. Where the grass was
an earthy, dull brown, the breeze had gently brushed it
with its magical fingertips and breathed a fine lucious
green colour into it.

Now, the burning field was lit up with a golden sun, and the
grass was slightly damp, with the scent of dew lingering
in the air. But the imaginator itself was shrouded an darkness.
Anybody sane could notice that the poor machine was in a bad
condition; the field stretched out before it, brimming with life,
but the machine was trembling and creaking.

There was a sharp, abrupt crack. The Imaginator gave a
weak pant and the glass measuring device broke off. It was
sent flying like a piece of discarded junk. The imaginator
cried out in agony as its spindly legs gave way. It was positively
screaming for help-but the field was empty, but for some
frolicking mice, So there it was. The imaginator sat on in
the middle of a field it had created, a few feeble puffs of
Steam curling out of a bent pipe. And for many years to
come, people would wonder why in the world was there a rusty
toaster with a few bits glued on it lying in an open field
surrounded by waving wildflowers?
