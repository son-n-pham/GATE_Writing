The branch quivered. I shivered in the cold, dancing wind. Mum nudged me gently with a wing. She puffed her feathery chest and smiled down at me confidently.

“You can do it,” she whispered encouragingly, taking a deep breath and gazing at the sky.

I looked down, and suddenly, the tree I was perched on seemed so tall—if one of my talons slipped, I would plummet down like a chill rock. The ground down below was hard and rocky, with an unshifting, angry look. My heart was thumping against my chest, my mind was racing like a train. My brain was all foggy, and the star-studded sky above me was spinning.

The ground was miles and miles away, and I was going to fall, and I was going to die, and Mum would weep and weep, and I would fail my first flight. And even if I survived, I would be taunted and bullied and—

I WAS SO NERVOUS AND NAUSEOUS.

My brain went around in circles, and those circles went around in other circles. Everything went fuzzy and blurry. I felt another soft nudge. Mum looked at me with her bright eyes. She seemed to decode my thoughts.

“You CAN.”

I gulped. Could I?

And somewhere, tangled and snubbed over through the threads and doodles in my heart, I knew that I could.
