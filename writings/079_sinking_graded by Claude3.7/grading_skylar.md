### Detailed Rubric Assessment

1. Story Structure and Plot Flow (2/2 marks)

   - Evidence: "Noah stroked his long wispy beard nervously as he ran over... Noah put his hands on his hips angrily and growled like an annoyed bear"
   - Analysis: The essay has a clear beginning (discovery of water), middle (growing panic), and end (revelation of the prank). Events flow logically with smooth transitions.
   - Score Justification: Full marks awarded for strong narrative structure with clear progression from problem to climax to resolution.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue using this strong sequential storytelling approach in future writings.
   - Example of improvement: For even stronger transitions, consider adding brief time markers between scenes.

2. Topic Relevance (5/5 marks)

   - Evidence: "Noah's Ark" setting, animals on board, and the "sinking" theme directly address the image prompt.
   - Analysis: The essay fully engages with the prompt by creating a narrative centered around the ark appearing to sink, incorporating animals' reactions and Noah's response.
   - Score Justification: The essay consistently addresses the core elements of the prompt image, including the ark, animals, and sinking theme, with a creative twist.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue closely analyzing visual prompts to extract key elements for your stories.
   - Example of improvement: You might explore alternative perspectives, like writing from an animal's viewpoint in future prompts.

3. Atmosphere and Theme (2/2 marks)

   - Evidence: "The boat rocked from side to side in the salty, choppy waves which made Noah's stomach flip like an acrobat" and "the wood was slightly rotten and felt like cardboard"
   - Analysis: Creates a vivid atmosphere of panic and chaos, then shifts to humor and relief.
   - Score Justification: Strong sensory details establish mood effectively, with clear thematic development around panic and deception.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue using environmental details to establish mood.
   - Example of improvement: Consider adding weather elements or time of day to enhance atmosphere further.

4. Sensory Details (2/2 marks)

   - Evidence: "wet pink nose," "long fine whiskers," "soft paws patterning," "salty, choppy waves," "wood was slightly rotten and felt like cardboard"
   - Analysis: Incorporates touch, sight, and sound details naturally throughout the narrative.
   - Score Justification: Multiple sensory details are integrated effectively and enhance the storytelling.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue using diverse sensory details; consider adding more smell and taste elements.
   - Example of improvement: "The salty sea spray filled his nostrils with the sharp scent of brine" would add olfactory elements.

5. Character Development (1/2 marks)

   - Evidence: Noah shows worry, then anger. The giraffe, mouse, and baboon display distinct personalities.
   - Analysis: Characters have basic personalities but don't show significant growth or change through the story.
   - Score Justification: While characters have recognizable traits, they don't demonstrate substantial development or complexity.
   - Improvement Strategy: Show how characters learn or change from their experiences.
   - Example of improvement: "Noah's anger dissolved into reluctant amusement as he realized how much the animals needed laughter during their long journey."

6. Sizzling Start (1/1 mark)

   - Evidence: "WATER! WATER!" The giraffe yelped shaking it's long spotted neck"
   - Analysis: Opens with urgent dialogue and immediate action that draws the reader in.
   - Score Justification: The opening immediately establishes tension and interest.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue using this technique of starting with action or dialogue.
   - Example of improvement: Consider adding a surprising or unusual element to your openings to make them even more compelling.

7. Conflict Development (2/2 marks)

   - Evidence: Discovery of water → growing panic → ark tipping → revelation of prank
   - Analysis: The conflict builds logically with increasing stakes until the resolution.
   - Score Justification: Clear central conflict with creative complications (animals' panic) and satisfying resolution (the prank reveal).
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue developing conflicts with rising action and clear resolution.
   - Example of improvement: Add minor obstacles or complications during the rising action to increase tension.

8. Figurative Language (3/3 marks)

   - Evidence: "stomach flip like an acrobat," "stood straight up like he had been struck by lightning," "tears cascading down his cheeks in a waterfall," "growled like an annoyed bear"
   - Analysis: Uses multiple similes effectively throughout the story.
   - Score Justification: More than three instances of figurative language (primarily similes) are used effectively.
   - Improvement Strategy: Expand your figurative language toolkit to include metaphors and personification.
   - Example of improvement: "The wooden planks groaned in protest as the weight of the animals shifted" (personification).

9. Moral/Theme Message (1/2 marks)

   - Evidence: The story shows a prank and Noah's reaction but doesn't deeply explore consequences.
   - Analysis: There's an implied message about the effects of pranks/deception but it isn't fully developed.
   - Score Justification: A thematic element exists but isn't thoroughly integrated or explored.
   - Improvement Strategy: Develop a clearer moral by showing consequences of actions or character growth.
   - Example of improvement: Show how the prank affects trust between Noah and the animals, or how it changes their relationship moving forward.

10. Ending (1/2 marks)

    - Evidence: "Noah put his hands on his hips angrily and growled like an annoyed bear- wishing he hadn't been fooled so easily."
    - Analysis: Concludes with Noah's reaction but doesn't fully resolve the situation or provide deeper closure.
    - Score Justification: The ending is adequate and relates to the plot but doesn't offer surprising depth or tie up all elements.
    - Improvement Strategy: Develop endings that offer emotional resolution or insight beyond the immediate plot.
    - Example of improvement: Show the aftermath of the prank, perhaps with a lesson learned or a changed dynamic among the characters.

11. Original Idea (1/1 mark)

    - Evidence: The twist that the sinking was actually a prank by the animals.
    - Analysis: Creates an unexpected and humorous take on the Noah's Ark story.
    - Score Justification: The prank concept provides a fresh, surprising perspective on the familiar biblical story.
    - Improvement Strategy: Continue developing unique twists on familiar scenarios.
    - Example of improvement: Consider pushing your creativity further by imagining even more unexpected scenarios.

12. Technical Accuracy (0/1 mark)
    - Evidence: "it's long spotted neck" (its), "him self" (himself), inconsistent punctuation with dialogue.
    - Analysis: Several grammatical and punctuation errors affect the technical quality.
    - Score Justification: The frequency of errors impacts readability and polish.
    - Improvement Strategy: Proofread work carefully, focusing on apostrophe usage and dialogue punctuation rules.
