The ark is a large, dark brown wooden structure tilted to one side, with the word \"SINKING\" written in bold, black stylized letters at the top of the image. A multitude of animals are piled on top of each other and spilling out from the ark, including elephants, giraffes, rhinos, hippos, deer, lions, tigers, bears, and various smaller creatures.
