"WATER! WATER! "The giraffe yelped shaking
it's long spotted neck,
Noah stroked his long wispy beard nervously as he ran
over.
"We're going to DIE!" Squeaked a timid little
meta mouse with a little wet pink nose and long fine
whiskers. He ran in little circles, his soft paws
patterning on the wooden floor of the ark.

Noah shook his head anxiously and whispered some things
to himself as he shuffled after the giraffe. The boat
rocked from side to side in the salty, choppy waves
which made Noah's stomach flip like an acrobat.
The giraffe stopped abruptly and pointed a smooth
hoof at a growing puddle of murky water on the
floor. Noah bent down and swished about the water
and he gasped, horrified.
"There's a hole." He whispered shakily.
The wood was slightly rotten and felt like cardboard.
The giraffe screeched with horror and galloped away
screaming out the horrible news.

Noah could hear a lion's terrified bellow and he
could picture the chaotic scene vividly- the boat
tipped with all of the animals & sliding off with
all the water rising and rising.

But then-there was a lunatic worthy screech of
laughter. Noah stood straight up like he had been
struck by lightning and quickly hurried over to check
on the animals. Everyone was howling with
laughter-so much so that there were tears and
cries.

"IT WAS A PRANK!" An exhilerated baboon
cried, tears cascading down his cheeks in a waterfall.

Noah put his hands on his hips angrily and growled
like an annoyed bear- wishing he hadn't been fooled so
easily.
