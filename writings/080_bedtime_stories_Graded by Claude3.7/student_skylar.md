Betty hurried herself among the thick, warm blankets and fluffy white pillows. It was cold, dark, and damp in the burrow, and Betty was frightened. A little shiver ran down her back. She shivered under the blanket and reached a shaky paw out to flick on the lamp.

The soft, golden light illuminated Betty’s room—from the wooden bed and polished floor to the walls of dusty leather-bound books, and to the balls of yarn and knitting supplies strewn across the bedside table.

The lamp didn’t make it much warmer, so Betty called out for Mother Mouse. Betty could hear Mother’s paws pattering gently on the wooden floor and then the creak of an old, groaning door. Mother came in, wearing a brownish-green cardigan and bottle-green pants. She scurried over to the fireplace, and soon a warm, crackling fire was burning brightly in the hearth. The flames danced cheerily as Mother plopped herself next to Betty and fussed about. She tucked Betty’s chin in, fluffing her plump pillows.

“Can you read me a bedtime story?” Betty asked once she was nice and toasty in her bed, with the sweet taste of hot chocolate lingering in her mouth.

“Why yes, I can,” replied Mother, a smile crinkling her aged eyes.

She reached out a pink paw and slid a faded green book off a wooden shelf. The golden words Classic Fairy Tales were neatly printed on the cover. Betty snuggled up right next to Mother as she read aloud in a smooth, gentle voice. The images were forming vividly in Betty’s mind as she gazed in wonderment at the small words on the yellowing page. She felt so warm and cozy, and a soft mewl left her lips as she lay in bed, watching Mother reach out and point at Cinderella’s glass slipper.

She truly appreciated how incredibly lucky she was to live a peaceful, lavish life in a burrow with a wonderful mother.
