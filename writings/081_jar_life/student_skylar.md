Little Jane Robinson sat glumly in her jar gazing wistfully at the world ‘outside’. She looked at her log table slumping against the smooth glass. Atop the chopped tree stump table was a carefully designed teapot engraved with flowers; it was her most treasured possession along with a matching teacup and cracked saucer. Alongside the porcelain cup and teapot was a pink plate with four balls that looked like crumbs from her owner, carelessly dropped into her jar. Jane was especially proud of her plate; she had fashioned it from the magenta bushes and the pinky orange wattle flowers that shone like a soft sunset.

Jane glared at her ‘teapot’. She didn’t know why she created it in the first place. She had been sold and trapped in a glass jar for as long as she could remember. Over the tedious, mundane years her owners would jam a leaf inside, and then sticks decorated with cotton. A collection of eccentric items had formed over the years and Jane felt like involuntary scavenger or hoarder, being locked up with a variety of lost things. Jane had contemplated renaming herself ‘Jane the hoarder’.

The idea seemed wonderful and exciting and her stomach lightened and flicked it up like light bulbs. That was until she realised there was no point. She felt dejected and small again. Jane put her head in her pale hands and felt hot tears trickle down her cheeks. She would have stayed there crying if not for the tap-tap.

The cat gazed at her with bright, inquisitive greeny-yellow eyes. It had a delicate pink nose and long fire whiskers, and most unbelievably, it opened its mouth. Jane gasped as the words hit her and almost knocked her over.

“I can help you.”
