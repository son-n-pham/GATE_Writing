It was all so big and colourful. The sun hovered
high in the sky like an old guardian guarding the
Vibrant campus: I was jostled around like a mouse
trapped in a storm of routing waves. All I could see
I was an army of elbows and legs-white ones, black
ones, pink ones, yellow ones, grey ones, peach ones,
leven purple ones. I was blinded by all the brightness
and I clutched my timetable so tight my knuckles turned
ighostly white.
All the shouting and people seemed to close in on me.
almost as imposing as the tall buildings made of
vivid colours and materials.

" Um ... "I squeaked."Do you know where-"

I was cut off by a loud, booming bell, and then
everything grew more faster and I got dragged along
with the massive flow of people.

Everything was a massive blur there were heavy blue
bags rich indigo fur coats and the rumble of
Skateboards. I was lost and lonely and it was only
my first day, I gazed up hopefully at the bright
blue sky every aching part of my body wishing
I could be navigated out of my mess.

And then, quite suddenly, the wind changed directions.
it was so subtle and small no- one noticed except
the swaying orange trees,

As I was lost and lonely, I saw a
small pink hand shoot out of the crowd and
reach out towards me.

"Hold on " I heard a high, determined
voice cry.
