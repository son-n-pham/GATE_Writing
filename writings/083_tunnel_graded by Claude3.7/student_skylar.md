Jimmy was all alone. The leafy walls seemed to close in and suffocate him.He buried his tender pink nose into the itchy grass that laughed mockingly and tickled his long fine whiskers. Jimmy’s prison cell was damp and desolate. His amber eyes had only just gotten used to the eerie darkness, but sometimes he still shivered as the leaves rustled and whispered.

With not even a dainty ladybird to whisper hoarsely to, Jimmy just sat down on the choppy grass and gazed up at the ceiling; once in a blue moon, he could just spot a darting ball of weak light flicker up and then disappear. Every dragging minute reminded him of how he was wrongly accused.

One bland day, Jimmy stared at the wall unblinkingly. His stomach was a growling hungry bear, but the grass would never make a satisfying meal as it tingled as it slipped down his throat. Jimmy sniffled as he thought of his friends, who turned him in, claiming he had vandalized the garden. As his mind was wandering off, he just missed the rustling of leaves from right in front of him.

And then as Jimmy looked down, he saw it. It slowly grew larger.
“Light?” Jimmy croaked, shuffling towards it, transfixed.

The hole in the wall was getting larger by the minute, and soon, it had cast a warm sliver of golden light onto Jimmy’s weary face and fluffy ears. He pressed his nose to the hole, and he breathed in the cool, refreshing air outside.
Oh, how he missed it. Then, he slowly crept forward and saw a thin tunnel twisting itself in crazy directions, and then he saw a furry little face staring at him with mild interest. It was a small mouse with large eyes and teeth. It boasted round, grey ears and petite pink paws.
“I came to save you!” the mouse smiled.
Jimmy’s face lit up like a dawn. Then, he scurried out of his prison and wrapped the kind mouse in a warm, thankful hug.
