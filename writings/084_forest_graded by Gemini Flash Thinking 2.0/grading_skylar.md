### Detailed Rubric Assessment

#### 1. Story Structure and Plot Flow (2/2 marks)

- Evidence: "The bright red door opened; what a sight it opened up to... The heavy door swung closed with a resounding thump behind me."
- Analysis: The essay starts with the action of opening the red door and entering the forest, establishing a clear beginning and setting the scene for the narrative. The closing door marks a transition into the new setting.
- Score Justification: The essay has a clear beginning, middle (exploration of the forest), and end (anticipation of future exploration), with a logical flow of events.
- Improvement Strategy: The structure is already well-defined for a short essay. For longer pieces, consider outlining key plot points before writing to ensure a more complex and engaging structure.
- Example of improvement: For a longer story, you could outline a specific goal or challenge the character faces in the forest, creating a more elaborate plot flow.

#### 2. Topic Relevance (5/5 marks)

- Evidence: "It was like I had stepped into a vivid dream bursting with towering trees... Everything seemed to be the same softy turquoise colour- apart from the twinkling fairylights and flouresent electric blue lanterns."
- Analysis: The essay directly responds to the visual prompt, focusing on the forest, red door, lights, and lanterns. The description vividly captures the key elements of the image.
- Score Justification: The essay fully and consistently addresses the prompt, with every section directly relevant to the described forest scene.
- Improvement Strategy: Topic relevance is excellent. Continue to closely observe the prompt and ensure all elements are incorporated thoughtfully in future essays.

#### 3. Atmosphere and Theme (2/2 marks)

- Evidence: "It was like I had stepped into a vivid dream bursting with towering trees... The cool river twisted like a calm snake through the forest and the breeze danced through my short black hair."
- Analysis: The essay effectively creates a dreamlike and enchanting atmosphere through descriptions of color, light, and gentle movement (breeze, river).
- Score Justification: Vivid setting details like "vivid dream," "towering trees," "turquoise colour," and "twinkling fairylights" effectively reinforce a magical and wondrous theme.
- Improvement Strategy: The atmosphere is very well established. In future essays, experiment with contrasting atmospheres or shifts in mood to add complexity.
- Example of improvement: You could introduce a sense of mystery or slight unease within the enchanting forest to create a more dynamic atmosphere.

#### 4. Sensory Details (2/2 marks)

- Evidence: "towering trees that reached up with their long fingertips to brush the golden heavens above... cool river twisted like a calm snake... breeze danced through my short black hair... fingers lightly brush the rough bark"
- Analysis: The essay incorporates a range of sensory details, including visual (turquoise color, lights), tactile (rough bark, cool river), and auditory (whisper - implied).
- Score Justification: The essay naturally incorporates multiple sensory details, enhancing the reader's immersion in the forest setting.
- Improvement Strategy: Sensory details are strong. Continue to engage multiple senses in your descriptions.
- Example of improvement: In future essays, try to incorporate less common senses like smell or taste if appropriate to the scene to further enrich the sensory experience for the reader.

#### 5. Character Development (1/2 marks)

- Evidence: "I had never before enjoyed nature... In That world suddenly felt so mundane and flat compare to the new world I was experiencing."
- Analysis: The character expresses a shift in perspective, moving from a dislike of nature to appreciation. However, personality traits remain basic.
- Score Justification: Some development is present in the character's changing feelings towards nature, but distinct personality traits beyond wonder and awe are not deeply explored.
- Improvement Strategy: Focus on developing more distinct character traits beyond reactions to the setting. Explore motivations, backstories, or internal conflicts.
- Example of improvement: You could hint at why the character previously disliked nature and what specific aspects of the forest are causing this change of heart, adding depth to their development.

- Score Justification: The opening line is engaging and creates immediate curiosity.
- Improvement Strategy: The start is effective. Continue to begin your essays with engaging openings.
- Example of improvement: Experiment with different types of sizzling starts, such as dialogue or a surprising statement, to vary your approach.

#### 7. Conflict Development (1/2 marks)

- Evidence: "I had never before enjoyed nature... In That world suddenly felt so mundane and flat compare to the new world I was experiencing."
- Analysis: The conflict is internal â€“ the character's prior lack of appreciation for nature versus their newfound wonder. The resolution is implicit in their enjoyment of the forest.
- Score Justification: A basic internal conflict is present, but the progression and resolution are predictable and not deeply explored.
- Improvement Strategy: Develop clearer and more engaging conflicts. Introduce external conflicts or more complex internal struggles.
- Example of improvement: You could introduce a challenge within the forest, such as getting lost or encountering a mysterious creature, to create a more developed conflict.

#### 8. Figurative Language (3/3 marks)

- Evidence: "river twisted like a calm snake," "metal cubes everyone called rooms," "trees that reached up with their long fingertips to brush the golden heavens above," "I was a gaping fish. I was a starstruck cow."

- Score Justification: The essay demonstrates effective use of more than three types of figurative language, enriching the writing.
- Improvement Strategy: Figurative language is excellent. Continue to use it to enhance your writing.
- Example of improvement: Experiment with more subtle or extended metaphors to add layers of meaning to your figurative language.

#### 9. Moral/Theme Message (1/2 marks)

- Evidence: "I had never before enjoyed nature... In That world suddenly felt so mundane and flat compare to the new world I was experiencing. It was such a lovely forest and I absolutely adored it"
- Analysis: The essay conveys a message about appreciating nature, but it is somewhat explicitly stated rather than naturally integrated into a complex narrative.
- Score Justification: A moral message is present but feels somewhat obvious and forced.
- Improvement Strategy: Integrate moral or thematic messages more subtly into the narrative. Show, don't tell, the message through character actions and plot events.
- Example of improvement: Instead of stating "I had never before enjoyed nature," you could show the character's transformation through their interactions with the forest and their internal thoughts, making the message more impactful.

#### 10. Ending (1/2 marks)

    - Evidence: "was excited to leave behind my old metal foot prints on the dirt path and replace them with new turquoise ones."
    - Analysis: The essay concludes with the character's anticipation of future exploration, providing an adequate but somewhat predictable ending.
    - Score Justification: The ending is adequate but lacks surprise or a strong sense of closure.
    - Improvement Strategy: Aim for more surprising or thought-provoking endings. Try to tie up loose ends in unexpected ways or leave the reader with a lingering question.
    - Example of improvement: You could end with the character discovering something unexpected in the forest or facing a new challenge, creating a more impactful conclusion.

#### 11. Original Idea (1/1 mark)

    - Evidence: "Everything seemed to be the same softy turquoise colour- apart from the twinkling fairylights and flouresent electric blue lanterns."
    - Analysis: The concept of a turquoise forest with unique lighting elements adds a touch of originality.

#### 12. Technical Accuracy (1/1 mark)

    - Evidence: "soughty turquoise colour", "rooms' walking", "flatcompare" - minor errors.
    - Analysis: There are a few minor spelling and punctuation errors, but overall technical execution is good.
