The bright red door opened; what a sight it opened up to. I gripped my bookmark so tight my already pale knuckles turned a ghostly white. I gasped. The heavy door swung closed with a resounding thump behind me.

I was dazzled. It was like I had stepped into a vivid dream bursting with towering trees that reached up with their long fingertips to brush the golden heavens above. Everything seemed to be the same softy turquoise colour- apart from the twinkling fairylights and flouresent electric blue lanterns. 

The cool river twisted like a calm snake through the forest and the breeze danced through my short black hair.

"Wow" I whispered; those were the only words that could slip out of my frozen mouth. I was a gaping fish. I was a starstruck cow. I was illuminated. When I had managed to move my shaking legs, I trotted out on a dusty dirt path, letting my fingers lightly brush the rough bark of the trees.

I had never before enjoyed nature. I was cooped up in metal cubes everyone called rooms' walking on concrete pavements in and learning against stone benches. In That world suddenly felt so mundane and flatcompare to the new world I was experiencing. It was such a lovely forest and I absolutely adored it, was excited to leave behind my old metal foot prints on the dirt path and replace them with new turquoise ones.
