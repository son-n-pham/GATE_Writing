“You’re supposed to draw something, not fold it!” Tim groaned and rolled his electric blue eyes.

Sammy grinned happily. Tim’s comment had bounced off of him like a ball.

“That’s why I want to be different!” Sammy cried eagerly.

Tim rolled his eyes like an exasperated older brother and gazed glumly at the ginormous sheet of white paper.

Sammy was absolutely itching with excitement and the greatest fits of energy he had held back. His fingers twitched, and he was jogging quickly on the spot as he boasted his ideas to the reluctant Timmy.

“And I’ll make a MEGA boat with this paper!” Sammy was squealing. “And then drop it in the water and I can go sailing!”

The image was forming perfectly in Sammy’s wild and wonderful brain: there would be a light fog with cool rippling water. The wind would dance gracefully through his hair as the paper boat glided forward. There would be lush green mountains—great giant guardians—rising out of the water.

Sammy’s eyes were glazed over, and he was swaying on the spot. Tim prodded him in the arm, and Sammy jumped to attention like an alert soldier.

“We’re starting,” Tim whispered.

As soon as those words reached Sammy’s ears, he leapt forward. All the other kids were drawing wonky flowers or houses, but Sammy was folding the colossal page, creasing the corners.

Tim stood in the background, burying his pink face in his hands with embarrassment. Sammy was dashing this way, heaving the paper in his small arms, and pushing it down.

“Do you know what Sammy’s doing?” Miss McGrath whispered urgently.

Tim shrugged, his face still in his hands. Sammy was completely oblivious to the attention he was drawing to himself. He was in his happy place, his home. Here, he didn’t care what anyone thought of him. He would pursue his eccentric dreams, and if he didn’t reach the summit on his first determined try, he would go again.

Sammy was a steel ball of perseverance and fun, and as he gazed at his paper boat, there was a party going on inside of him with confetti fluttering down.
