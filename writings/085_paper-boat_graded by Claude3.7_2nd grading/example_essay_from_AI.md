# Paper Dreams

"Are you really going to do this?" Maya asked, her voice wavering between amusement and concern as she watched me fold the giant sheet of paper I'd spent my entire savings on.

"Every adventure starts with a single fold," I replied, carefully pressing along the creases of what would become the bow. The paper was thick and sturdy, specially ordered from an art supply store three towns over. It had cost me six months of allowance, but some dreams are worth every penny.

Maya sat cross-legged on the grass, squinting up at me. "The lake is freezing this time of year, and paper boats sink. That's literally what they're known for."

I didn't respond immediately, concentrating instead on the precise folding technique I'd practiced a hundred times on smaller sheets. Each crease had to be perfect; this wasn't just origami—it was architecture, engineering, and magic rolled into one.

"This isn't ordinary paper," I finally said, running my fingers along the water-resistant coating. "And I'm not making an ordinary boat."

Three weeks ago, I'd seen the photograph in Grandpa's old album—a young boy sitting in a paper boat that seemed impossibly large, floating on a lake surrounded by mountains that looked exactly like the ones behind our house. The inscription on the back simply read: "Dreams take you places. 1957."

When I asked Grandpa about it, his eyes had sparkled with a mischief I hadn't seen since Grandma passed. "Some journeys can only be taken in vessels we create ourselves," he'd said, and wouldn't explain further.

The final fold locked into place with a satisfying sound. Maya stood up, brushing grass from her jeans, her expression softening as she beheld my creation.

"It's... actually beautiful," she admitted.

The boat was larger than I'd imagined, its crisp white surface gleaming in the afternoon sun. The design was simple but elegant—a scaled-up version of the boats I used to race in rain puddles as a child, but reinforced and modified based on designs I'd researched online.

"Help me get it to the water?" I asked.

Together we carried it down to the lake's edge. The water was mirror-smooth, reflecting the mountains like a perfect twin world beneath the surface. My heart pounded as we placed the boat gently onto the water.

"It's floating!" Maya gasped as the boat settled onto the surface without taking on a single drop of water.

"Your turn to be surprised," I grinned, carefully climbing in. The boat dipped slightly but remained buoyant. I settled into the center, feeling the gentle rocking beneath me.

"This is insane," Maya whispered, but she was smiling now. "Where will you go?"

I looked out across the lake toward the mountains that had watched over our little town for centuries. They appeared hazy and mysterious in the afternoon light, like guardians of secrets waiting to be discovered.

"Just to the middle and back," I said. "This time."

A light breeze caught the boat, pushing it gently away from shore. Maya grew smaller as the distance between us widened. The sounds of the shore faded, replaced by the subtle lapping of water against paper and the whisper of wind.

In the perfect stillness of the lake's center, time seemed to pause. The mountains embraced me from all sides, their reflection creating a circle of peaks above and below. I trailed my fingers through the cool water, watching the ripples disturb the mirror image beneath.

Grandpa's words echoed in my mind: "Some journeys can only be taken in vessels we create ourselves."

I understood now. This wasn't about defying physics or proving others wrong. It was about creating something impossible and trusting it to carry you—even if just for a moment—into a world where imagination and reality meet.

When I finally returned to shore, Maya helped me pull the boat back onto land. "Well?" she asked.

I smiled, feeling something new and unshakable within me. "Next weekend, we're making one for you too."

She looked at me, then at the mountains, then at our impossible boat. "I think I'd like that," she said.

As we walked back toward home, the paper boat left delicate wet marks on the ground behind us—proof of an impossible journey, drying quickly in the afternoon sun.
