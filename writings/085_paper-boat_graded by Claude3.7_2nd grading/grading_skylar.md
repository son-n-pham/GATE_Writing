# Grading Report for Skylar

## Detailed Rubric Assessment

1. Story Structure and Plot Flow (1/2 marks)
   - Evidence: "Sammy was folding the colossal page, creasing the corners. Tim stood in the background, burying his pink face in his hands with embarrassment."
   - Analysis: The essay has a beginning that sets up the characters and scenario well, but lacks a complete middle and end. We see Sammy starting his project but don't see its completion or aftermath.
   - Score Justification: While there is logical sequence and flow to the presented narrative, the story feels incomplete without showing what happens when/if Sammy completes the boat.
   - Improvement Strategy: Extend the narrative to show the completion of the boat and perhaps Sammy's experience using it or others' reactions to the finished creation.
   - Example of improvement: "As the final bell rang, Sammy held up his completed paper boat triumphantly. 'See? I told you it would work!' he exclaimed to Tim as they headed to the lake behind the school to test his creation."

2. Topic Relevance (5/5 marks)
   - Evidence: "And I'll make a MEGA boat with this paper!... The image was forming perfectly in Sammy's wild and wonderful brain: there would be a light fog with cool rippling water. The wind would dance gracefully through his hair as the paper boat glided forward."
   - Analysis: The essay directly addresses the image prompt of a paper boat on water with mountains in the background. It cleverly provides context for how such a scene might come to be through a child's imagination and determination.
   - Score Justification: Every section of the essay relates to the paper boat theme with excellent integration of the visual elements from the prompt.
   - Improvement Strategy: While perfectly relevant, you could further incorporate more elements from the image prompt like specific references to the reflection on the water or the clouds in the sky.
   - Example of improvement: "Sammy imagined the boat gliding across the glassy surface of the lake, its white form perfectly mirrored in the still water below, just like in his daydreams."

3. Atmosphere and Theme (2/2 marks)
   - Evidence: "There would be lush green mountains—great giant guardians—rising out of the water... Sammy was a steel ball of perseverance and fun, and as he gazed at his paper boat, there was a party going on inside of him with confetti fluttering down."
   - Analysis: The essay establishes a whimsical, imaginative atmosphere that perfectly supports the themes of creativity, determination, and individuality.
   - Score Justification: The sensory details and emotional descriptions effectively create an atmosphere that enhances the central themes.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue to maintain this strong connection between atmosphere and theme in future writings.
   - Example of improvement: This aspect is already strong, but could be enhanced by contrasting the classroom's structured atmosphere with the freedom Sammy feels in his imagination.

4. Sensory Details (2/2 marks)
   - Evidence: "The wind would dance gracefully through his hair as the paper boat glided forward" and "electric blue eyes" and "cool rippling water"
   - Analysis: The essay incorporates visual, tactile, and kinesthetic sensory details throughout the narrative.
   - Score Justification: Multiple sensory details are integrated naturally into the storytelling.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue this excellent use of sensory details and consider adding auditory or olfactory elements.
   - Example of improvement: "The gentle lapping of water against paper and the fresh scent of the lake filled Sammy's senses as he imagined his voyage."

5. Character Development (2/2 marks)
   - Evidence: "Tim rolled his eyes like an exasperated older brother" contrasted with "Sammy was a steel ball of perseverance and fun"
   - Analysis: Both main characters have distinct personalities. Sammy is enthusiastic, imaginative, and determined, while Tim is more conventional and concerned with appearances.
   - Score Justification: The characters feel authentic with clear traits that influence their actions and reactions.
   - Improvement Strategy: Building on this strength, consider showing some evolution in Tim's perspective by the end of the story.
   - Example of improvement: "As Sammy's boat took shape, Tim's expression slowly shifted from embarrassment to reluctant admiration."

6. Sizzling Start (1/1 mark)
   - Evidence: "You're supposed to draw something, not fold it!" Tim groaned and rolled his electric blue eyes.
   - Analysis: The essay begins with dialogue that immediately establishes conflict and character dynamics.
   - Score Justification: The opening line effectively captures reader interest and sets up the central situation.
   - Improvement Strategy: This is well-executed; continue using dialogue or action to create engaging openings.
   - Example of improvement: This aspect is already strong.

7. Conflict Development (1/2 marks)
   - Evidence: "Tim rolled his eyes... Sammy was dashing this way, heaving the paper in his small arms... Tim shrugged, his face still in his hands."
   - Analysis: There is a basic conflict between Sammy's unconventional approach and Tim's embarrassment, but it lacks development and resolution.
   - Score Justification: While conflict is present, we don't see complications or a satisfying resolution.
   - Improvement Strategy: Develop the conflict further and show how it is resolved - does Tim come to appreciate Sammy's creativity? Do other students react?
   - Example of improvement: "At first, the other students snickered at Sammy's strange project, but as the magnificent boat took shape, their laughter turned to amazed whispers. Even Miss McGrath, who had been about to intervene, stood back with growing admiration."

8. Figurative Language (3/3 marks)
   - Evidence: "Tim's comment had bounced off of him like a ball," "great giant guardians," "Sammy was a steel ball of perseverance," and "a party going on inside of him with confetti fluttering down."
   - Analysis: The essay employs multiple types of figurative language including simile, metaphor, and personification effectively.
   - Score Justification: More than three types of figurative language are used naturally to enhance the narrative.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue this excellent use of figurative language while ensuring it always serves the story.
   - Example of improvement: This aspect is already excellently executed.

9. Moral/Theme Message (2/2 marks)
   - Evidence: "Here, he didn't care what anyone thought of him. He would pursue his eccentric dreams, and if he didn't reach the summit on his first determined try, he would go again."
   - Analysis: The essay naturally integrates themes of individuality, creativity, and perseverance.
   - Score Justification: The moral message about pursuing your own path despite others' opinions is thoughtfully woven into the characterization and events.
   - Improvement Strategy: This is well-executed; continue to integrate themes organically.
   - Example of improvement: This aspect is already strong.

10. Ending (1/2 marks)
    - Evidence: "Sammy was a steel ball of perseverance and fun, and as he gazed at his paper boat, there was a party going on inside of him with confetti fluttering down."
    - Analysis: The ending captures Sammy's enthusiasm but doesn't fully conclude the narrative arc or tie up the story elements.
    - Score Justification: The ending provides emotional closure for Sammy's character but leaves the actual plot unresolved.
    - Improvement Strategy: Develop an ending that shows the completion of the boat project and its consequences.
    - Example of improvement: "When the bell rang, Sammy carefully carried his completed masterpiece outside. As he gently placed it on the pond's surface and watched it float perfectly, just as he had imagined, Tim's embarrassment melted away. 'Wow,' Tim whispered, 'you really did it.' Sammy just smiled, already dreaming of his next impossible creation."

11. Original Idea (1/1 mark)
    - Evidence: The entire concept of a student making an actual paper boat during an art class while imagining sailing in it.
    - Analysis: The essay presents a fresh approach to the prompt by showing the creation process of the boat rather than just a journey in it.
    - Score Justification: The narrative takes a unique angle on the prompt that differentiates it from more predictable responses.
    - Improvement Strategy: Continue developing unique perspectives on prompts.
    - Example of improvement: This aspect is already strong.

12. Technical Accuracy (1/1 mark)
    - Evidence: The essay overall shows strong command of grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
    - Analysis: There are no significant errors that impact comprehension or flow.
    - Score Justification: The technical execution supports rather than distracts from the storytelling.
    - Improvement Strategy: Maintain this attention to technical accuracy.
    - Example of improvement: This aspect is already strong.
