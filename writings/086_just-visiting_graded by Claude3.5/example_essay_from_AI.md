Time Traveler's Rest

The scarlet cottage materialized with a gentle whump, sending ripples across the rain-slicked cobblestones like a pebble disturbing a still pond. Steam curled from its chimney into the midnight sky, where stars played hide-and-seek behind storm clouds. The brass plaque above the door flickered in the streetlight's glow: "JUST VISITING."

Inside, Professor Adelaide Blackwood adjusted her brass goggles and consulted the temporal compass on her desk. Its needle spun wildly before settling on "1889 - Victorian London." She sighed, her breath fogging the window pane. This wasn't her intended destination - she'd been aiming for the Renaissance to collect data on Leonardo da Vinci's flying machines.

The house groaned like an old ship at sea, its timbers still settling after the temporal jump. Outside, loose bricks from neighboring buildings clattered across the street, displaced by the quantum turbulence of her arrival. A gas lamp tilted at a precarious angle, its flame sputtering in protest.

"Oh dear," Adelaide muttered, watching a young constable approach through the downpour. His eyes widened at the sight of her little red house, which certainly hadn't been there during his previous patrol. She could already hear tomorrow's headlines: "MYSTERIOUS DWELLING APPEARS IN WHITECHAPEL."

But before the constable could reach her door, the temporal compass began to hum. The storm intensified, lightning illuminating the cobblestones like flash powder. Adelaide felt the familiar tingle of chronological displacement beginning again.

"Just visiting," she whispered apologetically to the bewildered constable, as her cottage began to fade. "Always just visiting."

The last thing she saw before the time vortex claimed her was the young man's face, mouth agape, as her home dissolved like morning mist. Perhaps she'd return someday to explain - but then again, some mysteries were better left unsolved.

In the end, only the rain remained, drumming its eternal rhythm on the empty cobblestones where a scarlet cottage had briefly paused between moments in time.
