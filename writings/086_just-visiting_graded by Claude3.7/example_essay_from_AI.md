# JUST VISITING

The words hung in the air above the little red house like an apology to the neighborhood. They glowed faintly in the darkness, casting an eerie blue light onto the wet cobblestones below. Rain had been falling steadily for hours, transforming the ancient street into a glistening mirror that reflected the flickering street lamps.

Mia pressed her fingertips against the cool glass of her bedroom window, watching with wide eyes as the strange house sat where nothing had been just yesterday. It had appeared sometime during the night—a perfect little red cottage with smoke curling from its chimney, surrounded by a scattered pile of bricks as if it had crashed through invisible walls to get there.

"Mom!" she called, her breath fogging the window. "It's still there!"

Her mother appeared in the doorway, dark circles under her eyes. "What's still there, sweetheart?"

"The visiting house," Mia said, pointing. "Can't you see it? Right there in the middle of Cobble Square, with the words above it."

Her mother squinted through the window, then sighed heavily. "Mia, we've talked about this. There's nothing there but the usual square and street lamps."

But Mia knew what she saw. The little red house with its crooked chimney and warm yellow windows stood out against the gloomy sky as clearly as anything she'd ever seen. And behind one of those windows, a figure moved—an old man with wild white hair who sometimes looked directly at her and waved.

Today, Mia decided, she would visit him.

The rain had tapered to a fine mist by the time she slipped out the back door, her yellow raincoat buttoned up to her chin. Her rubber boots splashed through puddles as she approached the strange little house. Up close, it seemed even more out of place—as if it had been plucked from a fairy tale and dropped unceremoniously into their modern world.

"Hello?" she called, standing before the rough wooden door with its brass knocker shaped like a bird in flight. "Is anyone home?"

The door creaked open, revealing the old man she'd seen through the window. His eyes crinkled at the corners when he smiled, reminding Mia of paper that had been folded and unfolded too many times.

"I've been waiting for you," he said, his voice like rustling leaves. "Not many can see us when we're just visiting."

"What do you mean, 'just visiting'?" Mia asked, nodding toward the glowing words above his house.

The old man stepped aside, gesturing for her to enter. The inside of the house was larger than it appeared from outside—much larger. Books lined every wall from floor to ceiling, and strange instruments cluttered every surface. The air smelled of cinnamon and old paper and something unfamiliar that made Mia think of lightning.

"We travelers move between worlds," he explained, settling into a worn armchair by the fire. "This house carries me where I'm needed. I solve problems, gather stories, then move on."

"What problem are you solving here?" Mia asked, perching on a footstool opposite him.

The old man's eyes—clear blue like summer skies—fixed on her face. "You, my dear. You're the reason I'm here."

Mia felt a chill that had nothing to do with her damp clothes. "Me? But I don't have any problems."

"Don't you?" he asked gently. "The dreams that wake you screaming? The shadows you see that others don't? The feeling that you don't quite belong in your own life?"

Tears sprang to Mia's eyes. How could he know about the nightmares that had plagued her since her father disappeared last year? The therapist had called them "stress responses," but they felt more real than that—as if she were seeing through a window into another place where her father was trapped, calling for help.

"You're not imagining things," the old man said, answering her unspoken question. From a shelf, he retrieved a small wooden box inlaid with mother-of-pearl. "Your father crossed over, but not by choice. He's caught between worlds."

Mia's heart hammered against her ribs. "Can you... can you bring him back?"

"No," the old man said sadly. "But you can."

He opened the box, revealing a compass unlike any Mia had seen before. Instead of directions, the face was marked with symbols she didn't recognize, and the needle spun wildly before settling on one that looked like a twisted tree.

"This will guide you to the thresholds between worlds," he explained, placing it in her trembling hands. "But remember—you'll only have until the next full moon to find him and return. After that, my house will move on, and the doorway will close."

"Why me?" Mia whispered. "Why not someone stronger or smarter?"

The old man's smile was like sunshine breaking through clouds. "Because love is the strongest magic there is, and no one loves your father more than you do."

That night, as Mia clutched the compass beneath her pillow, she gazed out at the little red house and the glowing words above it. "JUST VISITING," they proclaimed to a world that couldn't see them. Temporary. Fleeting. A reminder that some gifts come to us briefly, and we must be brave enough to seize them while we can.

Tomorrow she would begin her search. Tonight, for the first time in a year, she slept without nightmares.

And in the morning, when she looked out her window, the little red house was gone—leaving nothing behind but a circle of crushed cobblestones and a newfound courage blazing in her heart like a beacon.
