The chimney belched out huge puffs of steam that curled up and mingled with the dark clouds above. The lamp post creaked and toppled over as the loose bricks rolled across the cobbled street. The stars twinkled in the sky as the wind danced around the old red house.

An old hobbling lady tottered out to the window and thrusted it open, letting the cool air rush in.

“What a nice, pleasant day,” she said in a hoarse voice.

She didn’t seem to notice that her pale, trembling home had dropped out of the muggy sky and landed on a street in the dead of the night.

Her body was so frail and weary she had to lean on the peeling windowsill. Her foggy, befuddled mind had already forgotten what had happened. She smiled placidly with her dry, cracked lips.

All of the magic surrounding her had made her shoot up like an electrified cat and drop down to who knows where. Everyone had thought the old lady too eccentric, living alone in a red tin house nestled in a wild valley. Nobody reached out to help her; however, it was clear she needed it. As she moved, her joints cracked and creaked like an old door.

When she hobbled out, she was startled when there were no waving blades of grass and swaying willow trees. Stumbling around, she was a lost and senile old lady. From behind a curtain, Sammy gasped as he saw the old lost lady wandering around.

He rushed out the door, a fresh new coat bundled in his arms. The old lady slowly turned around, her eyes glassy. Sammy rushed over.

“You okay?” he whispered.

The old lady nodded absently and babbled a few words under her breath. Sammy draped the wrinkly prune of a lady in the coat and led her to his red brick home. He sat her down in a soft scarlet armchair and gave her a warm cup of tea as he cared for her.
