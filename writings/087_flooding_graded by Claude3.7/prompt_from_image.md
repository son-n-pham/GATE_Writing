# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "I see a flooded street scene with two adults and one young adult sitting in a large, black inner tube, likely used to navigate the high waters. The water is a murky brown color, indicating it is likely unsanitary and possibly contaminated. Buildings are visible in the background, some of which appear to be partially submerged. In the foreground, a sign is visible. The male in the front is wearing a white t-shirt and is on the right side of the image. The woman in the middle is wearing a patterned top with green leggings. The younger male in the left is wearing a red t-shirt and khaki shorts.\n\nThe main elements are the people, the floodwater, the inner tube, and the surrounding buildings. The dominant colors are brown, red, white, and black. Text is visible on the sign.\n\nThe writing task could require students to describe the scene, imagine the thoughts and feelings of the people in the inner tube, or analyze the social and economic implications of the flood.\n\nThis image serves as a prompt by providing a visual representation of a real-world situation (a flood) and inviting students to engage with the scene imaginatively and analytically."
