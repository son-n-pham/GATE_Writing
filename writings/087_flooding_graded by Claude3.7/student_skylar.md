The water was dirty and angry. It washed out in my wet red shorts. My bare feet scraped on the rough ground; my slippers had been washed away by the flood. I dragged the black boat behind me. I waded through the water. I saw the crumbling buildings and broken windows, but it was natural. This was home, and grief ate me like a canvas filled with dull grey strokes.

The wind danced through my short black hair as Enzo shivered. I could see terrified heads bobbing in the water. I felt that a pang of sadness of the helpless children separated from their petrified families.

A few lost drops of rain plopped on the growing mass of grubby flood water.

“Should we help them?” I asked my brother.

Enzo shook his head and held on very tightly to the black boat like it was a thin cord that kept him alive.

As I waded on, I gazed at everyone staring hopefully at our boat.

“We should—”


“No, thank you.” I snapped selfishly.


This time, I ignored him.


“Here,” I reached out a hand to a scared little girl.

“Thank you,” she whispered.

And by the way she smiled, I knew I had just saved a life.
