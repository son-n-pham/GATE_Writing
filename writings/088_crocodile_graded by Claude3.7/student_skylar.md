The lake was calm and still. It glistened like a jewel as the warm sun bathed it with golden light. The tall, rough trees that surrounded it were forest guardians; with them standing there, I felt cozy and safe, lying on the mound of dirt, gazing at my fishing line. The cool, refreshing air danced through my hair, and I giggled with glee as I felt a soft tugging on my fishing line.
