# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "The image shows a scene split between above and below the water in a swamp or bayou. Above the water, a small figure, possibly a child, sits on a small, muddy bank with a fishing rod, framed by reeds and trees. The light above is hazy, suggesting a morning mist. Below the water, a large, cartoonish crocodile lurks, its head visible with a mischievous grin and many teeth. Tall green reeds partially obscure its body, adding to the underwater atmosphere. The color palette is dominated by greens and browns, with a touch of red on the figure's hat. The text 'CROCODILE' is at the very top of the image.\n\nThe writing task requires students to be inspired by this image, and write a short story.\n\nThis image serves as a prompt by presenting a setting, characters (a child, a crocodile), and a potential conflict or story (fishing in crocodile-infested waters). It invites creative writing exploring themes such as danger, surprise, nature, and the unexpected.",
