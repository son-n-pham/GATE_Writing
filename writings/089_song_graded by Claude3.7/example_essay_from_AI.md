# The Unexpected Duet

The morning sun cast a golden glow over the countryside as I perched on the telephone wire, my chest swelling with pride. For three generations, the RedFeather family had been renowned for their dawn serenades, and I, Maestro Crimson, was the most talented of them all.

"LAAAA-DIIIII-DAAAAA!" I belted out, my eyes closed in passionate concentration. The vibrato in my voice sent ripples through the air, rustling the emerald leaves below. My crimson feathers gleamed like polished rubies in the sunlight as I poured my soul into each note.

"Excuse me," came a timid squeak from nearby.

I continued my aria, pretending not to hear. No one interrupted Maestro Crimson during a performance!

"Excuse me!" The voice grew slightly louder.

With an exaggerated sigh, I opened one eye to find a small, trembling bird perched a few feet away on the wire. His crimson plumage was duller than mine, and he fidgeted nervously, looking as though he might take flight at any moment.

"What?" I snapped, irritated at having my morning concert disrupted. "Can't you see I'm practicing for the Annual Forest Symphony?"

The smaller bird winced at my harsh tone. "I'm sorry to interrupt, but..." he hesitated, his voice barely above a whisper, "your singing is scaring away all the insects. I haven't eaten since yesterday."

"Scaring away insects?" I scoffed, feathers ruffling in indignation. "My voice is a gift to this forest! Everyone loves my singing!"

The smaller bird's eyes widened in disbelief. "Have you... have you ever actually asked anyone?"

The question hit me like a cold raindrop. In truth, I'd never bothered to ask. Why would I? I was Maestro Crimson!

"The rabbits hide in their burrows when you start," the small bird continued, gaining courage. "The squirrels stuff acorns in their ears. Even the trees seem to bend away from your... um... performances."

"That's preposterous!" I declared, though a seed of doubt had been planted. "My family has been singing here for generations!"

"And for generations, the forest has endured it," he replied softly.

I opened my beak to deliver a scathing retort but found myself speechless. The small bird's words echoed in my mind like ripples in a still pond. Had I truly been so blind? So deaf to everything but my own voice?

The telephone wire suddenly felt cold beneath my feet. The breeze that had seemed to carry my notes now whispered accusations through the trees. I looked around at the empty branches that should have been filled with morning activity.

"I... I didn't know," I finally admitted, my magnificent voice reduced to a humble murmur.

The smaller bird inched closer, his fear gradually subsiding. "Perhaps we could try something different?"

"Different? What do you mean?"

"Maybe... instead of singing solo, we could try a duet? Something softer? I'm not very loud, but my grandfather taught me some lovely melodies."

I felt a strange warmth replace my wounded pride. No one had ever offered to sing with me before.

"I don't know any duets," I confessed.

"I could teach you," he offered, his eyes brightening. "My name is Echo, by the way."

"Crim—" I paused, realizing something important. "Just call me Crimson."

As the sun climbed higher in the azure sky, two birds—one large and one small—could be seen on the telephone wire, heads bent together in concentration, practicing a gentle melody that floated harmoniously over the forest. And for the first time, the woodland creatures emerged from hiding to listen, nodding in approval at the unexpected duet.
