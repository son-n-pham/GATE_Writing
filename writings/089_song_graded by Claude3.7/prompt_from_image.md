# Image Writing Prompt

{
  "description": "I see two cartoon birds perched on a wire against a blurred background of blue sky and greenery. The word \"song\" is written in bold, stylized letters above the image. The bird on the left is larger and predominantly red with white on its belly, and its eyes are closed as if it's singing. Its beak is open wide, suggesting it is vocalizing. The bird on the right is smaller, also red and white, and it has a startled expression with wide eyes. The wire they are sitting on is thin and dark, contrasting with the softer colors of the background.\n\nThe writing task requires the user to write about the scene, possibly creating a story or narrative involving the two birds and their interaction.\n\nThis image serves as a prompt by sparking creativity regarding what song the first bird is singing, why the other bird looks surprised, and generally what the relationship and circumstances might be between the two birds in this setting. It encourages imaginative writing based on the characterizations and setting presented.",
