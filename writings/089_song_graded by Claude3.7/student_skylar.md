The golden sunlight bathed me like a spotlight as I sat on the thin powerline and sang my heart out. My vivid orange fur was a star-studded neon dress fit for a celebrity, and I puffed my round, white chest out.


“Um,” said a shaky, timid voice. “Excuse me?”

My eyelids flickered open like a light bulb, and I looked down at a petite little bird; he had fidgety fingers and twitching minute feet.

“Can you please stop singing?” he said, cringing away from me.

“My singing is simply extravagant!” I claimed, letting the cool, dancing wind ruffle my feathers.
The smaller bird coughed uncomfortably, edging away from me.

“Listen to my song!” I demanded crossly.
It was so confusing—how could no one like my song? The trembling bird shook his head and scuttled still further away from me.
I huffed and chased after the ungrateful bird. My voice shook with uncontrolled rage as I advanced.

“You must LOVE my songs!” I sang loudly, in a voice that made the trees whimper.

The small bird covered his ears, yelping:
“PLEASE CONSIDER OTHERS!” he cried, plugging his ears with his wings.

As the words hit me, I stumbled backward. Those three words hit me hard, sinking into me like a reminder.
I gazed at the plain, blue sky, my eyes glazing over. My mind went foggy as the small bird’s words echoed through my head.
I stood up and shook myself. I looked over at the panting bird that stared at me with pure terror in his eyes.

And the word that came out of my beak was not a note, but a solemn apology.

“Sorry,” I whispered, guilty tears trickling down my cheeks.
