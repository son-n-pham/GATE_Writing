# A Balanced Diet

The library café buzzed with quiet conversation as I stirred honey into my Earl Grey tea. Steam rose from the porcelain cup like morning mist, carrying bergamot notes that mingled with the scent of old paper and polished wood. Outside, rain tapped a gentle rhythm against the windows, nature's own reading soundtrack.

"Your usual order?" asked Maya, sliding a plate across the oak counter with a knowing smile.

But this wasn't my usual blueberry scone. Instead, a leather-bound volume sat on the white china, its spine cracked in several places, pages fanned out like layers of a decadent cake. A golden ribbon bookmark dangled from between the pages like a strand of caramel.

"Very funny," I replied, raising an eyebrow.

Maya leaned forward, her dark curls falling around her face. "Dr. Abernathy says you haven't been to your nutrition consultations in weeks. He sent me a rather strongly worded email."

I groaned and took a sip of tea. My brother-in-law, the nutritionist, was relentless.

"I don't need another lecture about balanced diets and protein intake," I muttered. "I'm perfectly fine."

"Are you though?" Maya's eyes flickered to my wrist, thinner than it had been months ago. "Your body needs nourishment, Em. So does your mind."

I stared at the book-on-plate arrangement. It was Jules Verne's "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea," my childhood favorite.

"When was the last time you read something that wasn't a medical journal or research paper?" she pressed. "When was the last time you consumed anything that wasn't just... functional?"

The question hung in the air between us, heavier than I expected. Since starting my residency, life had become a blur of hospital corridors, quick protein bars between shifts, and collapsing into dreamless sleep. Efficiency above all else.

"Stories are sustenance too," Maya continued, gentler now. "Remember how you used to devour novels? One a week, sometimes more. You'd come in here glowing, desperate to discuss plot twists and character arcs."

I traced the embossed title on the book's cover. The memory of underwater adventures and Captain Nemo's magnificent Nautilus stirred something long dormant within me.

"A balanced diet," Maya said, sliding into the seat opposite me, "isn't just about counting macros and vitamins. It's about feeding all the parts of yourself that hunger."

I carefully lifted the book from the plate, feeling its satisfying weight. The pages parted easily at the ribbon, revealing familiar words that had once transported a younger me to ocean depths and extraordinary voyages.

"Start small," she suggested, pushing the tea closer to me. "A chapter with breakfast. A page before bed. Think of it as... literary nutrition."

I smiled despite myself. "Prescribed reading? Is that covered by my health insurance?"

"First one's on the house," Maya winked, standing up. "But I expect a full report on how it tastes."

That evening, I ran a bath for the first time in months, brought my tea and the book with me, and sank into steaming water. As I turned the first page, I felt a different kind of hunger stir—one I had neglected for too long. By chapter three, I was ravenous, consuming paragraphs like a starving woman at a feast.

When I finally emerged, pruney-fingered but satisfied, I realized Maya was right. A truly balanced diet required more than mere calories and nutrients. Some hungers could only be satisfied by diving into oceans of imagination, by tasting adventures on the tip of your tongue as you whispered the words aloud.

I reached for my phone and texted Maya: "Delicious. May I have seconds?"
