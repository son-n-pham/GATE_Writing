4. Sensory Details (2/2 marks)
   - Evidence: "Steam rose from the porcelain cup like morning mist, carrying bergamot notes that mingled with the scent of old paper and polished wood. Outside, rain tapped a gentle rhythm against the windows, nature's own reading soundtrack."

   - Score Justification: Full marks for rich, varied sensory details that enhance the reading experience.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue incorporating multiple senses in descriptions.
   - Example of improvement: Your sensory details are excellent. In future writings, you might experiment with synesthesia (blending senses) for even more unique descriptions.

5. Character Development (2/2 marks)

   - Score Justification: Full marks for a clear conflict that progresses naturally toward resolution.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue developing conflicts with appropriate complications and resolutions.

   - Analysis: Uses multiple types of figurative language effectively: similes, metaphors, and personification ("Some hungers could only be satisfied by diving into oceans of imagination").
   - Score Justification: Full marks for varied and effective use of figurative language.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue using diverse figurative language devices.
   - Example of improvement: Your figurative language is strong. Consider how metaphors might be extended throughout a piece to create deeper symbolic meaning.

11. Original Idea (1/1 mark)
    - Evidence: The specific combination of a medical resident neglecting self-care, a café owner intervening, and the parallel between physical and mental nourishment.
