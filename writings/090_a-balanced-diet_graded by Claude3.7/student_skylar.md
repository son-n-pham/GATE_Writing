The orange juice slipped down my throat. It was sweet and cool. My teacup clinked as I placed it on the wooden table. I took a deep, calming breath in, letting the air dance through my short, black bob. The sky above me was a pale, light blue that was almost white; it was a canvas that was getting ready to be painted.

I sat like I was meditating on a red yoga mat, cross-legged, mixing my orange juice with a teaspoon. Then, I reached out and turned on my podcast.

“Take a deep, soothing breath in…” said a calm voice, booming out of my speaker.

I inhaled and exhaled, gently closing my eyes.

“Today’s Softly Stepping Safari will be focused on having a nice, balanced diet.”

At this, my eyebrows shot so high they were lost in my fringe.

“Yes, indeed,” the podcast continued. “We need a balanced diet of reading.”

I snorted and laughed hollowly.

The last time I had laid a finger on a book was many years ago. I could never stand the musty smell.

“Reading isn’t mundane as it seems,” the podcast said calmly, as if it sensed my feelings.

I wrinkled my nose in pure disgust and reached out to turn the droning podcast off—until I heard four distinct, very powerful words.

“Try it. It helps.”

I paused, my finger hovering over my phone. The words echoed in my brain.

In the corner of my eye, I saw a thick, triangular book, shoved carelessly under a pillow. I cautiously pulled it out and flipped open to the first frail page. It read: This was how it all began.

And, immediately, I was intrigued, placing the book on my plate, now buried inside its descriptions.
