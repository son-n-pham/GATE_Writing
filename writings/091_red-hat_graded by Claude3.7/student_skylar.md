The hall was dark. Long black shadows danced across the polished wooden floor. The air was filled with the clicking of neat boots. The workers strode off to wherever they needed to be, clutching their black suitcases and suits. It sounded like a mournful funeral march—all except for an out-of-beat tapping.

The golden sunlight poured into the hall like a spotlight, illuminating a peculiar man. He wore a dazzling white suit with a sparkling red tie and hat.

He skipped merrily along, briefcase swinging.
“Good day to you, Phillip.” He smiled, revealing a neat row of white teeth.

Phillip, a tall man in a black suit, wrinkled his nose slightly, as if he had just smelled a burning pie.
“Good day,” Phillip said crisply, walking swiftly.

The man in the red hat chuckled to himself after watching all the solemn faces around him, bobbing around him—a sea of sadness.
“Why are you so tediously dull!” he cried, turning around, his voice bouncing around the hall.

He danced around, shaking people’s hands and dragging them out to a lively tango. There was a deathly silence as the Man in the Red Hat paused to catch his breath.

And then there was a snort. Then a snigger.
Then laughter so loud the hall shook.
