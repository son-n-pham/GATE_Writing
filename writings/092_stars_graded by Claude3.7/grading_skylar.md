   - Score Justification: Full marks awarded for excellent structure with natural progression of events and clear sequence.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue developing multi-part narratives with clear beginning, climax, and resolution.

- Strategic Development Plan:
  Skylar shows impressive command of language mechanics and creativity. To continue advancing as a writer, focus on developing deeper characters whose personalities and backgrounds inform their actions.

Your natural talent for atmospheric writing and figurative language provides an excellent foundation for these more advanced narrative techniques.
