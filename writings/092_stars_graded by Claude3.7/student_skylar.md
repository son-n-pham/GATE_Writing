I pedalled faster than I had ever pedalled, the paper aeroplane clutched in my hand. It was like a priceless gold nugget to me. I panted heavily as sweat poured down my forehead in a stinging waterfall. The meadows stretched around me like a never-ending sea of waving grass.

I had to get there before the stars came out. My legs ached and my bike wobbled. The cool wind danced through my hair and flew into my face. I was gripping the paper aeroplane so tightly my knuckles turned ghostly white and my fingernails dug painfully into my palms.

My sparkling green eyes scanned the field, looking for the neat circle of swaying wildflowers. I bit my lip as the sun sank lower, casting a soft salmon pink glow over my pale face. My heart was a frantic bass drum thumping against my ribs.

“Where is it?” I whispered, spinning around.

Then I saw it. A neat ring of alabaster-coloured wildflowers. As I came closer, carefully dragging my bike behind me, they seemed to greet me, waving pleasantly. I stood in the middle and gazed up at the sky. It had turned a beautiful purple colour, dotted with twinkling stars. I reached a shaking hand out and aimed my paper aeroplane at the sky.

And as it flew gracefully into the air, the sky flashed a brilliant aqua. The colour danced around me as the stars smiled. I stared transfixed.

I had written all of my problems and worries into that paper plane. Were the stars going to reject it? My whole body shook, and my legs felt like two pieces of jelly.

The aqua light glowed brighter than ever as I gazed up in awe and terror. Each star blinked once and grew larger. I gasped as the light flicked off and I was cast into darkness. I held my breath.

“Very well,” said the stars in a majestic, booming voice. “Do not despair. Have hope.”

I let out a long sigh of happiness and relief. The stars blew out a final puff of life, and everything turned on again, twinkling like nothing had happened.
