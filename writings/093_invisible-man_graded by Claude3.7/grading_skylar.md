### Detailed Rubric Assessment

1. Story Structure and Plot Flow (2/2 marks)
   - Evidence: "There were two large boots attached to a short sock-length jeans...I peeked my head out. 'Thank you,' I whispered, as the invisible man smiled."
   - Analysis: The story has a clear beginning (encountering the invisible man), middle (their interaction and offer), and end (the character accepting the offer and expressing gratitude). The events flow logically with smooth transitions between scenes.
   - Score Justification: Full marks awarded because the narrative follows a coherent sequence with natural progression from the initial encounter to the final resolution.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue developing this strong sequential storytelling in future writings.
   - Example of improvement: Consider adding more detail about the journey to wherever the invisible man is taking them to further enhance the middle section of the story.

2. Topic Relevance (5/5 marks)
   - Evidence: The entire story centers around an invisible man with a briefcase in an urban setting (a "dark, dingy alley").
   - Analysis: The essay fully addresses the prompt about an invisible man, incorporating the key elements from the image including the invisibility aspect, the briefcase, and the urban setting.
   - Score Justification: The story directly engages with all elements of the prompt in a meaningful way, creating a narrative that perfectly aligns with the assigned topic.
   - Improvement Strategy: This strong connection to the prompt is excellent—continue this approach with future prompts.
   - Example of improvement: None needed for relevance, though future stories could explore even more of the setting details suggested in prompts.

3. Atmosphere and Theme (2/2 marks)
   - Evidence: "The 'thing' had a low rumble of a voice that reverberated around the dark, dingy alley. I held my breath and took a shaky step back, my bare feet scraping against the rugged concrete."
   - Analysis: The writer creates a mysterious atmosphere that supports themes of homelessness, unexpected kindness, and hope. Sensory details about the alley and characters enhance the mood.
   - Score Justification: Full marks awarded for creating a consistent atmosphere that effectively reinforces the themes through vivid setting details.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue using descriptive language to establish mood and atmosphere in your stories.
   - Example of improvement: Consider adding weather or time of day details to further enhance the atmosphere.

4. Sensory Details (2/2 marks)
   - Evidence: "The wind danced quickly through my dirty, matted hair," "Lucy barked and squeezed herself between my shaky legs like a black feather duster with ears, legs, and a poofy tail," "all I could feel was the rough edges of the suitcase and Lucy's smelly fur."
   - Analysis: The story incorporates multiple sensory details naturally, including touch, sound, and smell.
   - Score Justification: Full marks given for the effective and varied use of sensory details that enhance the reader's immersion in the story.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue incorporating diverse sensory details in your writing.
   - Example of improvement: Consider adding more taste and specific visual details to round out the sensory experience.

5. Character Development (2/2 marks)
   - Evidence: The narrator begins defensive and bitter ("Nobody's ever helped me. I s'pose you're going to throw me some crumbs then meander off, stuck in your petty little lives.") but transitions to gratitude and hope ("...all of my bitterness and hatred seemed to melt away... 'Thank you,' I whispered").
   - Analysis: The main character shows clear emotional development from skepticism to trust within the short narrative.
   - Score Justification: Full marks awarded because the character demonstrates distinct personality and emotional growth throughout the story.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue developing characters who undergo emotional changes based on story events.
   - Example of improvement: Consider adding a brief flashback to show why the narrator is initially so distrustful.

6. Sizzling Start (1/1 mark)
   - Evidence: "There were two large boots attached to a short sock-length jeans. My jaw dropped open and wouldn't close, like someone had put a weight onto my tongue."
   - Analysis: The story begins with an unusual and intriguing image that immediately creates curiosity and pulls the reader in.
   - Score Justification: Full mark given for an engaging start that immediately introduces the unusual central element of the story.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue using unusual or striking images to begin your stories.
   - Example of improvement: This was very effective—continue this approach in future writings.

7. Conflict Development (1/2 marks)
   - Evidence: The implicit conflict is the narrator's homelessness and distrust of help, shown in lines like "Nobody's ever helped me."
   - Analysis: While there is an internal conflict (the narrator's distrust and decision whether to accept help), it's somewhat simplistic and resolves quickly without much complication.
   - Score Justification: One mark awarded because while a basic conflict exists, it develops predictably without complex complications.
   - Improvement Strategy: Add more obstacles or complications before the resolution to create tension.
   - Example of improvement: Consider adding a moment where the narrator almost decides not to trust the invisible man, perhaps seeing something concerning, before ultimately choosing to accept help.

8. Figurative Language (2/3 marks)
   - Evidence: "My heart was a bass drum, thumping quickly against my ribs," "Lucy...like a black feather duster with ears, legs, and a poofy tail," "My jaw dropped open and wouldn't close, like someone had put a weight onto my tongue."
   - Analysis: The writer effectively uses similes and metaphors to enhance the narrative.
   - Score Justification: Two marks awarded for the effective use of two types of figurative language (similes and metaphors).
   - Improvement Strategy: Incorporate additional types of figurative language such as personification or hyperbole.
   - Example of improvement: Add personification by describing how "the alley watched silently as the strange exchange took place" or how "the city held its breath around them."

9. Moral/Theme Message (2/2 marks)
   - Evidence: The invisible man states "it is my duty to help children in need" and the narrator's transformation from bitterness to gratitude.
   - Analysis: The story naturally integrates themes about unexpected kindness, looking beyond appearances, and hope for those in desperate situations.
   - Score Justification: Full marks awarded because the moral message about kindness and hope emerges naturally from the narrative without feeling forced.
   - Improvement Strategy: Continue developing themes that emerge organically from your stories.
   - Example of improvement: Consider showing the impact of kindness more explicitly through additional dialogue or inner thoughts.

10. Ending (1/2 marks)
    - Evidence: "I peeked my head out. 'Thank you,' I whispered, as the invisible man smiled."
    - Analysis: The ending provides closure to the immediate scene but leaves many questions unanswered about what happens next.
    - Score Justification: One mark awarded because the conclusion is adequate but somewhat predictable and doesn't fully resolve the larger situation.
    - Improvement Strategy: Develop more surprising yet satisfying conclusions that tie up loose ends while still leaving readers thinking.
    - Example of improvement: Add a brief epilogue showing where the invisible man takes them, or include a final twist that adds depth to the story.

11. Original Idea (1/1 mark)
    - Evidence: The concept of an invisible man using his abilities and briefcase to rescue homeless children and their pets.
    - Analysis: The story presents a fresh perspective on the "invisible man" trope by making him a benevolent figure who helps those in need.
    - Score Justification: Full mark given for the unique approach to the invisible man character and the creative use of the briefcase.
    - Improvement Strategy: Continue developing unique twists on familiar concepts.
    - Example of improvement: This was very effective—continue finding fresh angles on familiar tropes.

12. Technical Accuracy (1/1 mark)
    - Evidence: The essay has very few grammatical or spelling errors and demonstrates proper punctuation throughout.
    - Analysis: Technical execution is strong with appropriate dialogue formatting and sentence structure.
    - Score Justification: Full mark awarded for the high level of technical accuracy throughout the piece.
    - Improvement Strategy: Continue proofreading carefully to maintain this level of accuracy.
    - Example of improvement: Watch for occasional awkward phrasing like "smoothing out his tuftly moustache"—"tuftly" might be better as "tufted."

### Overall Assessment

- Key Strengths:
  1. Excellent use of sensory details that create a vivid reading experience
  2. Strong characterization that shows emotional growth in a short space
  3. Creative and original approach to the invisible man concept

- Priority Improvements:
  1. Develop more complex conflict with additional complications before resolution
  2. Create more surprising yet satisfying endings that fully resolve the story
  3. Incorporate more varied types of figurative language

- Strategic Development Plan: Skylar shows strong creative writing skills with particular talents in character development, sensory detail, and original ideas. To advance further, Skylar should focus on developing more complex plot structures with multiple complications before resolution. This could be practiced by outlining stories with at least three obstacles before reaching the conclusion. Additionally, Skylar could benefit from studying different types of figurative language and deliberately incorporating at least three different types in each story. Finally, working on crafting endings that surprise the reader while still providing satisfying closure would elevate the writing to an even higher level. Overall, this is an impressive story that demonstrates significant creative writing talent.
