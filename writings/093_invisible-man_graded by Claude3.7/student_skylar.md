There were two large boots attached to a short sock-length jeans. My jaw dropped open and wouldn’t close, like someone had put a weight onto my tongue. A large heavy briefcase was attached to a large pale hand that floated in the air. I stood there, rooted to the spot. Lucy growled, slinking through my lanky legs and glaring at the boots.

“Why, hello there.” said the ‘thing’ pleasantly, pausing in front of us.

The ‘thing’ had a low rumble of a voice that reverberated around the dark, dingy alley. I held my breath and took a shaky step back, my bare feet scraping against the rugged concrete. The ‘thing’s’ hands carefully dropped the briefcase on the floor and started doing something that looked quite a bit like unbuttoning a coat.

“No,” I whispered to myself. There was no coat to unbutton at all. I could see right through the spot where its chest would’ve been.

But then, amazingly, the hands lifted what appeared to be a soft blanket of—there was no other word for it—invisibility off his neatly buttoned-up work shirt that was tucked into some neat pants. The invisible man smiled at me, smoothing out his tuftly moustache and folding his coat.

I swallowed as the wind danced quickly through my dirty, matted hair. My heart was a bass drum, thumping quickly against my ribs.

“Who are you?” I asked in a trembling voice.

“I am him.” The man replied simply. “I am the invisible man, and it is my duty to help children in need—”

Lucy barked and squeezed herself between my shaky legs like a black feather duster with ears, legs, and a poofy tail.

“Haha,” I muttered. “Nobody’s ever helped me. I s’pose you’re going to throw me some crumbs then meander off, stuck in your petty little lives.”

The invisible man chuckled like I had said a funny joke.

“No, Mister Fox, I am here to give you a home.”

I laughed bitterly, my voice managing to come back, but the invisible man nodded sincerely. He opened his suitcase. It looked surprisingly large inside.

“You and your pet—”

“Lucy.”

“Yes, your dog Lucy, can go here. I shall put my coat on and we will be off.”

As I nodded, all of my bitterness and hatred seemed to melt away. I looked down at my grimy hands—and hungry Lucy.

“Okay.”

I was packed up, and all I could feel was the rough edges of the suitcase and Lucy’s smelly fur. I sensed I had forgotten something.

I peeked my head out.

“Thank you,” I whispered, as the invisible man smiled.
