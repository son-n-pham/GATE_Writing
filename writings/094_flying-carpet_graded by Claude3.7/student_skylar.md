The carpet glowed bright red like a lamp. I ran my trembling fingers over the soft, silky surface. It felt as light as a feather and as I slipped my fingers underneath it, I could feel a cool, strange material. It was smooth, slippery water woven into solidity.

Lucy wagged her grey tail and scurried forward to sniff the carpet. My eyes grew wide as teacups as I picked it up; the carpet shimmered like jewels.

“This is so cool!” I whispered in awe, setting it down onto the polished wooden floor.

I sat down on it and let my toes wriggle into the soft depths of the carpet.

Then, something absurd happened. The carpet twitched and the corners moved. Fine white sparkles danced around me and twinkled like stars. The carpet glowed brighter and brighter. But the best part of all was when it slowly rose into the air. Lucy ran around in circles underneath, yipping.

My heart was a bass drum thumping excitedly against my ribs as the carpet started to spin me in dizzying circles.

“I’m doing it, Lucy!” I cried as I reached down to brush my bed then touch the ceiling.

I remembered finding the magic carpet at a dump, discarded and torn. I had hurried it home on a pretend stretcher and washed and sewn it together. It seemed to be so grateful!

“Thank you so much, carpet!” I smiled, as I soared around, having the absolute time of my life, with my new friend: The Magic Carpet.
