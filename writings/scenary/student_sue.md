The sky is a blanket, a thick swath of grey and white. The air is cold and crisp, a breeze that lifts the edge of my patched cloak, stinging the exposed skin.

My fingers are cold and red with rash, knuckles swollen and clenched tight around the leather straps of the reins.

Corin lets out a low huff of exhaustion, hooves clopping and crunching against the undergrowth of sticks and leaves. He's slowed to a trot as he navigates through the trees, long grey ears lying flat on his head.

"Just hold on," I manage through gritted teeth, my breath loosening the hard dig of my feet in Corin's side. "Nearly there."

My thighs, legs, back ache from sitting straight in a saddle for so long. I'll have sores from this, I can tell without looking.

The castle is in our sights, a structure rising above the pines, white and grey and covered in hundreds of square windows. Nearly there.

The trees are thickening by the base of the hill, too close together to ride up on donkey-back. My dismounting is more of a fall and for a few moments, I lay groaning, mouth tasting of dirt, legs tangled in my cape. A ridiculous brown thing that kept me moderately warm and always tripped me up.

Corin chews morosely on a shoot of grass protruding from a tree root as I drag myself up on two feet.

The trees ahead of me do not look inviting, leaves knotted so close together the sky is barely visible through the canopy.

A responsible traveller would move around to the other side of the forest, take the more hospitable route to the castle entrance.

But I am neither responsible or a traveller. I am a messenger, tied to a time limit that could make or break my life.

I pull the bags off Corin, remove the saddle and let it drop uselessly to the ground.

"Go," I tell him. "You're a good donkey."

Corin flicks his tail, disinterested, and turns to eat a daisy.

I move my gaze back, up, to the castle. At the trees. I sling my rucksack over my shoulder and begin to hike.
